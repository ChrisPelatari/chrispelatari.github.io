title: Things that make you go...
---
Visual Studio .NET has not been my friend lately.

Last week, ASPNET was having issues - taking up to 4 minutes to compile a (relatively) small project. Now, I can't get to any SQL Server instance on my network - When I attempt to connect thru the server explorer, I get the nice friendly message "The specified procedure could not be found."

Thanks, Visual Studio.

I can't help but wonder if this may be intentional...VS.NET 2003 just came out, and now I'm having problems w/ 2002 after over a year of no problems...things that make you go hmm.
