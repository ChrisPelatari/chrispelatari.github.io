<p>-&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>I played with ClickOnce deployment for a little while earlier. After getting 
a couple of files/dependencies worked out, I had a fully installable ClickOnce 
application. It didn't let me specify where I wanted to install it, but I guess 
that's part of the deal for auto-updates etc.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to investigate this further...I knew ClickOnce was supposed 
to be cool, but <em>easy</em> too? Get outta here.</p>
