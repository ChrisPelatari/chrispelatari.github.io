  <p>Well, I woke up this morning and found myself back in Roswell, GA. It seems 
  that the <a href="googlecms" target="_self">Google trip</a> must have been a 
  dream. </p>
  <p>Don't you just love April Fools Day <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/wallym/" target="_self">Wally</a>?</p>
  <p>But thanks for the congratulations from a few friends and <a href="http://evitt.net/blog/archive/2005/04/01/357.aspx" target="_self">bloggers</a>Â (thanks <a href="http://evitt.net/blog/" target="_self">Josh</a>). I appreciate your thought that it might have been 
  possible!</p></blockquote>
