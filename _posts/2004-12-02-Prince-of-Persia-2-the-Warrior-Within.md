Damn.
  
That's right, I said Damn.

It looks and feels so much like the first one (which I beat about 6 or 7 
times without getting tired of it) but UbiSoft did a good job of extending the 
story; even making the Prince look and even move like he's older. It's the 
little details that I'm talking about - the fact that it takes him a little more 
effort to swing on poles and things of that nature.

I didn't seem to get very far in the game; since you go back and forth thru 
time you're really in the same area just in two different time frames. It did 
land me in the doghouse, tho, since I was only going to play for an hour or so 
and ended up playing like 4. Who needs sleep anyways, right? :)

P.S. I intentionally misspelled a lot of words in this post to test out the 
spell checker of <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>...works 
pretty well, that is, if you don't mind seeing markup when you spell check :) 
I've still gotta test it some more, but it should be ready pretty soon I 
hope.
