Get a heads up on running multiple versions of the Framework. [ShowUsYour-Blog!](http://dotnetweblogs.com/DNeimke/posts/3204.aspx)

I read Darren's post, and subsequently the referenced [article by Early &amp; 
Adopter](http://www.3leaf.com/default/articles/ea/SBS.aspx), and I must say that both were extremely helpful.

I haven't yet applied v1.1 of the Framework at the office, but I am using SxS 
execution at home, and I have run into a similar problem the Darren outlined - I 
just kind of moved on to the next thing I could try out - didn't really think it 
over too much. 

So does this mean that you're kind of bound to the version of VS.NET that you 
have loaded? Not according to the article. I wonder if the hard-coded framework 
issue applies also to [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.com) and [WebMatrix](http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/default.aspx?tabindex=4&amp;tabid=46), 
which are the tools I use at home. It would be interesting to find 
out!
