title: Score for CS Blogs
---
<p>I feel like a kid in one of those <a href="http://www.retrojunk.com/media/171/">old milk commercials </a>- you may 
try to com...ment $p4|\/| me, on....line pok...er, but my blog is running <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/">CS::Blogs</a>, so your stupid comment 
doesn't get past my inbox. Comment moderation: it does a blog good.</p>
<p><font color="red">update: </font>This blog is not running the version of 
CS::Blogs that has moderation. As a matter of fact, this blog is running .Text 
version 0.94 because of a bug in the Metablog API implementation of v0.95. Sorry 
to get your hopes up, I was talking about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CFrazier">my other blog on weblogs.asp.net</a>.</p>
