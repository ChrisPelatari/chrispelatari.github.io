title: Added 'Extending the MetaBuilder's RollOverLink' Story
tags: ASP.NET-WebControl-Development

<P>I just added a little explanation of how I extended the <A href="http://www.metabuilders.com/Tools/RollOverLink.aspx">RollOverLink</A>&nbsp;found on <A href="http://www.metabuilders.com/">MetaBuilders.com</A>. All I did really was add a statusbar message and change the way the DOM accesses the images. Big thanks to <A href="http://www.dotnetweblogs.com/asmith">Andy Smith</A>&nbsp;for helping me out with some of the ideas presented in his example, <A href="http://www.markitup.com/">markitup.com</A>&nbsp;for having a&nbsp;cool component that made it [pretty] easy to mark up my code(I only had to add my own &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags to make it show up correctly), and <A href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/DBrowning/">Don Browning</A>&nbsp;for giving me the extra push by example. </P>

<P>My snippet isn't quite as low-level I guess as <A href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/DBrowning/Story/3605.aspx">Don's snippit</A>, but maybe that just means I'm not as big of a nerd...NAH!! I think blogging past my bedtime about .NET pretty much puts me on a pretty high geek eschelon. </P>

<P>Anyways, if you're interested, my snippet can be found <A href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/Cfrazier/Story/3649.aspx">here</A>.</P>

<P>l8r,</P>
