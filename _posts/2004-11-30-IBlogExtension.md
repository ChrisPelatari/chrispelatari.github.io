<a href="http://yexley.net/blogs/bob/archive/2004/11/30/958.aspx">Bob wants 
to see some integration of RssBandit and PostXING.</a>
This was an idea I had really early on simply because a lot of the features 
in <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a> were, *ahem,* borrowed from w.bloggar, and RssBandit already supports a plugin that 
starts w.bloggar for posting to a weblog. So, why couldn't I do something 
similar?

Well, I thought that it had something to do with implementing IBlogExtension, 
for which I couldn't find too much documentation. Maybe it's such a simple thing 
to implement that onlyÂ a yutz like me would need documentation. I honestly 
don't know and haven't looked into it too much simply because I didn't have an 
immediate need for it. 

Once Dare adds deleting capabilities to <a href="http://rssbandit.org/">RssBandit</a>, I have a feeling that it's going to 
become my default aggregator again. After that, look out for an RssBandit plugin 
to post using PostXING.
