Whew! I've been uploading files for a minute over on the gotdotnet workspaces! It's kind of cool, tho - this is the first project that I've worked on with other .NET developers. It's cool to see others' code and see how they approach problems and attempt to solve them.

I'm enjoying it a lot, and I've even had a couple of things to contribute, believe it or not. This is also a good way to integrate my dotnetweblogs blog \[this\] with a different, personal blog that I can just blab on.

I'm guessing that most of the posts I make will be on both, seeing as I don't have a lot of interesting things to say that don't have to do with .NET -> I'm still building the other one for those few cases :) I just hope that ScottW doesn't change what a 'BlogPost' is too much - I'm stoked to get this stuff integrated. My other blog will be located above - just thought I'd share even tho you probably don't care. Whateva;)
