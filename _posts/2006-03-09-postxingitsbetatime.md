For the adventurous among you, we've decided to release beta 1 of <a href="http://postxing.net">PostXING</a> available for <a href="http://projectdistributor.net/Releases/Release.aspx?releaseId=325">download
at ProjectDistributor</a>!

There are a few known issues, but as far as I know there aren't any
showstopper bugs. I've been running the development build for quite some time
now, and for PostXING v1.1 users, I think this release is a big step up in terms
of usability. Since the only working provider at this time is the
MetaBlogProvider, the <strong>functionality</strong> remains basically the same,
i.e. you can manage a MetaWeblog enabled weblog using PostXING from your
desktop.

If you find any issues, bugs, or you just think something could be done
better, head on over to the <a href="http://postxing.net/gemini">Gemini issue
tracker</a>. To add an issue, click the <a href="http://postxing.net/gemini/Issues.aspx?pi=1&amp;m=1">All Issues
link</a> and then Create Issue at the top of the page. If you don't want to
get that involved, you can always use the <a href="http://www.postxing.net/blog/contact.aspx">contact form over at
PostXING.net</a> to at least get your issue addressed...or you could just
let it ride and hope I run into it myself :)

If you're feeling <em>really</em> adventurous and want to hack on PostXING,
you can do so by using <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> and pointing to <a href="http://postxing.net:8080/PostXING">http://postxing.net:8080/PostXING</a>.
All main development is done on the trunk by version. If you don't like how
something works, send me a diff. I think I've been pretty receptive to criticism
and feature requests (even tho we can't put them <em>all</em> in at once), so
the very least that will happen is that you will be able to use a program that
you feel works better. Thanks, and enjoy!
