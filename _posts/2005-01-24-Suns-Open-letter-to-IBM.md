title: Sun's Open letter to IBM.
---
<p>I am not an expert in this area. Not even close. Wouldn't even call myself an 
amateur. But I had to stop reading <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20050121">the 
letter</a> when he says "<!--StartFragment --><span class="body">It's the 
most secure OS the world has ever seen..."</span></p>
<p><span class="body">A quick hop over to the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">link provided</a> for solaris 
shows how proud they are...of thier new logo. Call me crazy, but if you were to 
make the claim that you are releasing the "most secure OS the world has ever 
seen", wouldn't <em>that</em> be what was <a href="http://openbsd.org/">highlighted on the front page of the site you are 
pointing to</a>? </span></p>
<p><span class="body">Right, different audiences, different priorities, different 
reasons for installing an OS, but if you are claiming that you have the "most 
secure OS the world has ever seen" (still can't get over that) - <a href="http://openbsd.org/">say it loud, proud, and in bright red letters on the 
first page of your site</a>. Heh.</span></p>
