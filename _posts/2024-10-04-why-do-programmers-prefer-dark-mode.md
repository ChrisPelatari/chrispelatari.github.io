# Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! ðŸ˜‚


I mean really, everything is light and possibility before it's observed. That's why you should have written your tests first. But I digress.

I wrote this silly dad joke to test out the new post script. I'm happy to report that it works as expected. The dad jokes will continue until morale improves.

```javascript
const
  light = 'attracts bugs',
  dark = 'repels bugs',
  mode = 'dark';
```
