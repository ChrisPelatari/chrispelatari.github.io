If you have PSD files, send them to me and I'll give it a whirl. If not, let me know and I'll start from scratch. While I wouldn't call myself 'skilled' at photoshop, I know my way around it. 

Can you give me a clear concept of what you want (like, do you want the current color scheme, only flashy, um, er? do you want the words 'Powered By: ASPNetWeblLog' to remain exactly as they are - considering CaPs and all? do you want to keep the gecko in the image?) Let me know.
