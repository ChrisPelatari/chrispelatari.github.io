I was able to get ruby installed on my MacBook thanks to [this guide](https://gorails.com/setup/macos/12-monterey). I already had [GitHub](https://github.com) setup, but I didn't have [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) installed. 

Following this guide got me back working in ruby without the friction.
