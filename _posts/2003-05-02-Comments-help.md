title: Comments...help?
---
Does anyone have any pointers / links / resources I could look at for supporting comments in a blog system? I think I'm ready to implement this over @ the infiniblog space.

I think the general way to go about this in asp.net is to use a web service? I'm trying to keep this as extensible as possible...just a nudge in the right direction should suffice. Thanks in advance to my 2 readers.
