<P>...the first issue of <A href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Contact/Newsletter.aspx">Ingo's Distributed .NET Newsletter</A>. If you are doing <U><EM>anything</EM></U> distributed in 
.NET, you need to be subscribed. Heck, you need to be subscribed anyhow because 
almost anything Ingo says is brilliant. [<a target = "_blank" href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/sgentile/posts/3966.aspx">Sam Gentile's Blog</a>]</P>
<P>Agreed. I was very happy to see it waiting in my inbox. Thanks 
Ingo!</P>

<P>I hate to be all me too and whatnot, but I must chime in concurrance. (just 
to spice up me too). I like the layout, it fits with <A 
href="http://www.ingorammer.com/">Ingo's site</A>&nbsp;in layout / color scheme, 
and the content - of course! But the layout is what first grabbed my 
attention&nbsp; - not just another 'oh here's a bunch of hyperlinks in text' 
newsletters. Sweeet. :)</P>
