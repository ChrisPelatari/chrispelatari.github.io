title: Jump into VB.NET - feet furst
---
<P>Today I'm applying OOP changes to a VB.NET dll that was upgraded from VB6 - so that means I'm taking out all of the On Error GoTo fnName_Error and Replacing them with Try..catch...end Try's.</P>

<P>This is taking some getting useed to. I'm so accustomed to adding the semicolon; at the end of a line that my pinky pushes that key just by habit...rrrgh.</P>

<P>I've also decided to add <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/MSDN-FILES/027/001/943/msdncompositedoc.xml">Microsoft's Exception Management Application Block</A>&nbsp;whil doing this little upgrade, because what better place to start, eh? A big help when starting out with this particular AppBlock was a quick read of <A href="http://www.devx.com/codemag/Article/10296/0/page/1">this article</A>, which not only explains how to get the default Exception publisher working, but also how to define your own simple custom publishers.</P>

<P>Bleh - I hate coding with VB, but I guess it's good to expand one's horizons. </P>
