title: "RE: Cross-posting - A new trend?"
---
<p>I started to make this a reply inÂ <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/shawnmor/archive/2004/12/17/323770.aspx#Feedback">Shawn's 
comments</a>, but decided it was getting too long-winded to be a comment. You 
get a post, Shawn. In his comments, someone suggested that he try out <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>, which is cool (!) but, he 
seems to have the wrong impression of PostXING's erm...limitations.</p>
<p>&gt;I did try PostXing, and it's another tool that assumes that cross-posting 
is against only one server.</p>
<p>It does? That's news to me! :)</p>
<p>The real limitation of the current PostXING drop is that it only expects to 
work with the metablog API. MT has its own API that is very similar, but not 
exactly the same which is bad news for an xml-rpc client. I guess I could add 
support for other authoring apis (ATOM is what I really have in mind - just for 
fun), but this is something that I do in my free time.</p>
<p>Add that to the fact that adding different authoring APIs would mean handling 
the configuration etc. differently within the app - I only ever intended to use 
this as a personal tool. My ideas are limited, but I'm always willing to at 
least consider (and usually try) feature requests, so if you use PostXING or 
would like to, let me know what you'd like to see or what you don't want to see 
anymore. I'm pretty open to suggestions, and I've come to the realization that 
most of the users of PostXING are way smarter than me anyways.</p>
<p>One idea that came up while all the hubbub was going on concerning the 
Provider Model was to use just that to make posting to different apis more 
transparent, but I'm usually against doing something just because it's the 
current "fad". The fact of the matter is that I've never needed the 
functionality to post to different types of api's than the metablog api, so I 
never put in the facility to do so. I would not, however, be against adding 
support for this particular feature if there is really a need (okay, come on - 
want) for it and I had some solid implementation suggestions for doing so.</p>
