title: RegExValidator Tester
---
I just had to do a test for a RegExValidator.

Wow! Interesting, no? Keep reading.

A while back, I had to do a few tests to check if certain regEx's would work in a regex validator. Since said validator uses JavaScript RegExp's, I couldn't test for validation on [Steve Smith's RegexLib.com](http://www.regexlib.com/). Great resource there, Steve - but I'm a web developer primarily. So I rolled my own.

You can find it on my little aspalliance web space [here](http://www.aspalliance.com/christopher/experiments/RegExValidator.aspx). I've used it quite a few times, but it's been a private deal - so there's no UI, no design went into it, it's simply a utility that works much like the tester on RegexLib; I simply made it work with a regexValidator so it requires one more postback. If any of my 2 readers enjoys this or finds it useful, please let me know. As always, feedback is appreciated - I'm still learning, here folks.

HAND.
