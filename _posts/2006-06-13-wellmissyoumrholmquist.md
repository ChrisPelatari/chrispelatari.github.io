<a href="http://www.click2houston.com/news/9358956/detail.html?subid=10100242#">My
high school principal died on Monday</a>.

This is surreal. It feels like it was just last week that I was skipping
class and getting a pep talk from Mr. Holmquist in North House. Worst of all, I
went to school with his daughters. Amber was in my graduating class, but she was
real into sports (and I wasn't). We had a couple of classes together but I was
closer to her sister Kendra, a fellow thespian.

This is so confusing...I've been in the Holmquist house a couple of times,
and now...we'll miss you, Mr. Holmquist. Alief is a sad town today.

In the unlikely event that either of my readers finds out any information
about the funeral, please let me know. My cell is (281) 684-5688. Alternatively,
if I find out anything I will post here.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">update</span>: I got this from a friend in the
district:

The Holmquist family
has made the following arrangements:

Viewing services will
be at Forest
Park on Westheimer at Dairy Ashford on Thursday evening
from 6-8 p.m.Â  The memorial service will be held Friday morning at 11:00
a.m. at Memoria Drive United Methodist Church on Memorial Drive between Wilcrest and the
Beltway.

Respectfully,

Paula
Smith
