<p>NEW: "PostXING" in about page now links to postxing.net.</p>
<p>NEW: FTP Settings page now is labeled as such. This was confusing in the new
user wizard.</p>
<p>FIX: Plugin ToolStripButtons now actually do something.</p>
<p>These are a couple of the things that I've fixed this morning based
on some really great feedback from a few really brave souls. The most work it
looks like is still going to be the options story. I knew this was going to be
the case when I announced the alpha, so thanks everyone for your
input!</p>
