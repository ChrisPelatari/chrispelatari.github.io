<p>So I haven't posted in a while. See, on Monday, my life changes. Exactly 
how, I'm not sure yet.</p>
<p>I'm going to family court to get joint custody of my son, Ethan. I haven't 
seen him in a few months, and I miss him terribly. Hopefully I will no longer 
have to wait and wonder if he's thinking about me, wondering how I am, if he 
misses me at all.</p>
<p>My son is almost three years old, and I finally get to be his 
Daddy. Pray for me. </p>
