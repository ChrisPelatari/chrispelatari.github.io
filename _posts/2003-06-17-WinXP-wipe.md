So, after my wah-wah yesterday about Visual Studio, I was looking thru my hotmail account and realized that they offer mobile services. Hey! I've got a cell phone now, let's try it out!

After the confirmation message, I got a horoscope:

*Scorpio: Today someone is being unreasonable. That someone could be you.*

As I'm reinstalling windows just because one or two programs aren't doing what they should be doing; as I am cursing Windows set up for not letting me delete C: as a partition; as I'm trying to figure out why everything is blowing up on me after so long having no problems.

Oh well, 29 minutes and a few key programs left.
