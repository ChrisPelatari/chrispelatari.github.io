  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I've uploaded a new release of 
  PostXING to <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">ProjectDistributor</a>. 
  This release adds the ability to Load or Save a post as a .htm file, as well 
  as managing your blog (Categories, Post, Post &amp; Publish, Cross-Post, 
  Delete, and plugins) from the Preview page.</p>

<p class="media" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I went ahead and included a 
couple of bugfixes that slipped into this release, so the <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.1.5012.2">latest version of PostXING </a>is 
now uploaded and reflected on ProjectDistributor. Sorry I let a couple of bugs 
slip in there. Thanks for the feedback, Bob!</p>
