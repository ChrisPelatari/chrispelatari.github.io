This is definitely filed under "As if you cared". My friend Peyman had a
little gathering at his new house in Austin this past weekend. I've been to
quite a few parties in my day, but I can honestly say that the girl that swung
balls of fire around herself was a first for me at a house party. (every time
I've seen/done something similar in the past, the lit part couldn't burn you.
glowsticks are good that way;)

I intended to stay only one night, but circumstances dictated that I stay
until Monday morning. At least I got to get a good glimpse of the only state
capital bigger than the federal government's building!
