title: New PostXING release
---
<p>I've added a small usability feature based on some <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2005/03/15/11201.aspx">recent 
feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Now, from the Tools -&gt; Options dialog, you can optionally set whether you 
would like to automatically create a new post when you hit Post or Post &amp; 
Publish. I also made some minor UI consistency changes, and removed a 
superfluous message that showed up in the options dialog in the last release 
(oops :)</p>
<p>So, go grab the new <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>. 
Enjoy.</p>
