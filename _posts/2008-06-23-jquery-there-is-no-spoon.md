I've been working with javascript almost since its inception. It was the first language that I ever really hacked in. I remember having to code around document.layers (blecch!), and I've used javascript with a fair amount of success in the past.

But lately I've been reading up on <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>. And I have experienced a profound moment of clarity. Using css selectors to manipulate the DOM is such a simple idea it qualifies as genius in my eyes. Using this along with asp.net mvc is simply a joy. There is no spoon.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0936894/">Spoon boy</a></b>: Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth.
<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/">Neo</a></b>: What truth?
<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0936894/">Spoon boy</a></b>: There is no spoon.
<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/">Neo</a></b>: There is no spoon?
<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0936894/">Spoon boy</a></b>: Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.
