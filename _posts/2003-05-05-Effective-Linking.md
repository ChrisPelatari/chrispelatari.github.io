title: Effective Linking

>&lt;snip&gt;
>If I'm referring to a person, I'll link directly to the home page of that persons blog, preferably identifying them however they choose to identify themselves on their blog.  This way, people who look for them using search engines find them the way they want to be found.  For example, If you search for Chris Hollander or ScottGu, we respectively show up the way we want to, without revealing extra information.
>&lt;/snip&gt;

Consequently, I gave my own name a shot (egotistical megalomaniac) with darn fine results I think - [Chris Frazier](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Chris+Frazier). Cool. Thanks, dotnetweblogs.com!
