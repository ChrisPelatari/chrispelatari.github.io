title: Coming real soon...

<p>I intend to use this blog engine more and more, but I've run into a snag that has held me back a bit - I don't know what the ParentID is supposed to be used for, and I don't want to go forward until I do.</p>
<p>I'm working on cross-posting right now so that I can use this blog full-time. I'm pretty sure I have 0 subscribers on /phoenix, but I'll make sure to include the proper redirects if I get an aggregator for the user-agent. Should be fun!</p>
