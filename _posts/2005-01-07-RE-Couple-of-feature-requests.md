  <p> <strong>Couple of feature requests </strong><br /><small>posted by Bob

  version. Spell checking works very nicely. There are a couple of things that 
  I've noticed about the application that I thought would make it nicer that I 
  wanted to mention. Fairly simple I'm pretty sure.<br /><br />First off, especially 
  with all of the different version releases you've had lately, I've wanted to 
  check the "About" box to make sure that the correct new version was running 
  after the new version, and I noticed that the current version isn't displayed 
  on it. It would be great to have the current version displayed on the About 
  box just for reference if nothing else.<br /><br />I've also noticed that when I 
  switch to the "Preview" tab, that the toolbar with the "Post &amp; Publish" 
  button disappears. Normally when I compose a new entry, I write it up in the 
  editor tab, and then I check spelling (well, I will from now on anyway), and 
  then I switch over to the preview tab to make sure everything looks OK with my 
  stylesheets applied and all. Well, if everything looks good, I'd like to be 
  able to just click "Post &amp; Publish" right then and there, but since that 
  toolbar is gone, I have to switch back to "Design" view to get that toolbar 
  back to publish the entry. It seems to me like that's a fairly common toolbar, 
  and maybe it (or it's buttons) should just be added to the standard toolbar 
  that has the "Setting" button on it. At very least, it would be nice to have 
  that one button displayed when using the "Preview" tab.<br /><br />Thanks for the 
  great free application though. I love it. </p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Now, that is some great feedback. I've got seperate use cases 
than what I always do and clear concise suggestions on how to implement them. 
These are the types of things that you as a developer don't tend to think of all 
the time because you are used to a certain useage scenario. I would have never 
thought of any of these (except maybe the about box thing. whoops :) There are 
of course some other things that I know the application needs - like for example 
validation maybe? Heh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Honestly, tho, I'm just glad that a few people are finding my humble 
little app useful. But to anybody else who is using <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>, I am always happy to at 
least consider making changes suggested on ProjectDistributor or my <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog">blog</a>. It just makes it so much 
easier (and therefore likely to get implemented) with great feedback like <a href="http://yexley.net/blogs/bob/">Bob </a>gave.</p>
