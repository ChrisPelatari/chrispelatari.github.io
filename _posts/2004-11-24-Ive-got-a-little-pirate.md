title: I've got a little pirate.
---
<p>My son, Ethan, has started pretending to be a pirate sometimes on the 
weekends that he visits me. </p>
<p>This past weekend, he got a sticker from Kroger's and proceeded to put it 
over his eye - <img src="/assets/images/11-20-04_1923.JPG" /></p>
<p>"aaah matey! wokka pank! (dat means tro u ovabord)" </p>
<p>Ethan sure knows how to make his Daddy proud! (I think it's hilarious)</p>
