Step1: install tortoisesvn.

Step2: open file dialog in vs.net (2008 at least)

Step3: XD

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">update:</span> looks like the tortoisesvn team brought back those nifty icon overlays in vista while I wasn't paying attention ;) Incedentally, there is an option to turn the icon overlays <span style="font-weight:bold;">off</span> in the open/save dialogs.
