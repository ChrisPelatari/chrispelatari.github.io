I noticed that github pages has updated its jekyll version, so to keep up I've
decided to start over again.

### simpler is better.

I also added a default Rakefile [from here](https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-rake-boilerplate)

this makes it easier to start posts.

Next I think I will be adding an archive page.
