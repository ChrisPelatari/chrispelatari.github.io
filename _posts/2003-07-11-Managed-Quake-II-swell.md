>The thing that sold Windows as a viable gaming platform for most people was the appearance of [WinQuake](http://www.bluesnews.com/guide/winquake.htm) (and then later GLQuake and QuakeWorld). Taking a cue from past days, Vertigo Software has ported the now GPL'd [Quake II engine to .NET](http://www.vertigosoftware.com/Quake2.htm) (using Managed C++, of course).
