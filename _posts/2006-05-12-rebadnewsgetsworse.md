<p>So what do you do when a blogger you read comes up on hard times and posts
his phone number to his blog? Call him, of course. The problem is that Robert is
suffering through an extremely personal trial, and right as he said "hello" I
started thinking of how I would feel if I were in his shoes. Probably did more
harm than good, but my thoughts and prayers are still with you and yours,
Robert.</p>
