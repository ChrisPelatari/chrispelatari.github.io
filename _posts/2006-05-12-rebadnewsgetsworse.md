<p>So what do you do when a blogger you read comes up on hard times and posts 
his phone number to his blog? Call him, of course. The problem is that Robert is 
suffering through an extremely personal trial, and right as he said "hello" I 
started thinking of how I would feel if I were in his shoes. Probably did more 
harm than good, but my thoughts and prayers are still with you and yours, 
Robert.</p>
