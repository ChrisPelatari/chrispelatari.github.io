title: Object ref....

Heh - I get more traffic [here](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/phoenix) and [there](http://weblogs.asp.net/CFrazier)  from a post I made a while back that had the words "Object reference not set...." you know, you've seen it.

I guess this is a really common problem. There's got to be a way to give developers, novice and seasoned, more information about this exception than is currently given. I'm sure there's someone in M$Land who can shed some light on this.

Any takers?
