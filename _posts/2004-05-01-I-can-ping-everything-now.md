title: I can ping everything now.
---
<p>Okay, not everything, but at least <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">www.weblogs.com</a> and <a href="http://blo.gs">blo.gs</a>.</p>
<p>I already had some of the code in place, but then I came across <a href="http://www.cookcomputing.com/blog/archives/000223.html">an example by 
Charles Cook</a>, mr. <a href="http://xml-rpc.net/">xml-rpc.net </a>hisself, and 
decided to hack it a little bit. Pretty simple stuff, but this post will tell me 
if it works :) </p>

<p>So it looks like it "kinda" worked for weblogs.com - since 
my blog engine, .Text pings weblogs.com itself, I got a nice little message from 
weblogs.com saying I should get out more and enjoy life for pinging twice in a 
row. Well, my friends, it's raining today. blo.gs came back saying that the 
server returned invalid xml.</p>
<p>Oh well, guess I'll try again on Monday :)</p>
