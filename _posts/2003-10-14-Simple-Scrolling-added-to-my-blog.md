title: Simple Scrolling added to my blog
---
I added a scroller over <a title="My Blog" href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog" target="_blank">here</a> - just some custom javascript. I wanted to get it working - it looks great on IE, I can't say the exact same for mozilla or opera, tho. I'm working on it :). I'm also working on giving it a cleaner UI w/ images instead of text - this is just the 'prototype' to see if I can get this scroller working.
