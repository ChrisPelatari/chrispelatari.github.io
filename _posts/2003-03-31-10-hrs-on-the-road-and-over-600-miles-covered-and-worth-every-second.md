I got back from seeing Ethan monster late Sunday afternoon...I'm just too proud. My boy is walking like a champ! Talking, too. I was holding him, and he reached out, grabbed my nose, and said "noshe".

I've got to say, tho - the best part of the weekend was when I was taking him inside and he laid his head on my shoulder, gave me a squeeze and said, "Daddy". That says it all.
