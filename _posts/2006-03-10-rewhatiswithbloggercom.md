<p>I had tried to reply to this post on WinExtra, but it errored out on me. So,
here's what the comment said:</p>
<p>Blogger uses Atom feeds located at <a href="http://blogdomain/atom.xml">http://blogdomain/atom.xml</a> The fact that
the skins provided don't reflect this is the pain point...you'd see a link if
you view sourced it:</p><pre><span style="color:blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color:maroon;">link</span> <span style="color:red;">rel</span>="<span style="color:blue;">alternate</span>" <span style="color:red;">type</span>="<span style="color:blue;">application/atom+xml</span>" <span style="color:red;">title</span>="<span style="color:blue;">Blue Phoenix</span>" <span style="color:red;">href</span>="<span style="color:blue;">atom.xml</span>" /<span style="color:blue;">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Also, get rid of that captcha (I hate those!) use ReverseDoS instead: <a href="http://angrypets.com/tools/rdos">http://angrypets.com/tools/rdos</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Blogging is cool and rss feeds make it even better for the reader/user; but
  only if blog hosts provide a mechanism for the blogger to have an RSS feed on
  their site which most do. </p>
  <p>The only exception I have found so far is blogs hosted by Blogger.com. Now
  I don't know if it is a setting that individual bloggers need to set but not
  one of the blogs on Blogger.com that I like seem to have an RSS feed. </p>
  <p>What is up with that silliness? </p>
