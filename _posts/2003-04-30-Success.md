Why didn't I see these 'ping' posts earlier? Looks to me like I've got some integration to clean up! HA!

So the posts below that say something like 'ping' were made from checking off a checkbox at [my other blog](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/phoenix), which means this stuff worked. :D Good. Now this also means that I have to figure out which one works...I tried quite a few different iterations (got up to 15 before I stepped away from it:S). So this is something you can do with webservices, eh? Spiffy.
