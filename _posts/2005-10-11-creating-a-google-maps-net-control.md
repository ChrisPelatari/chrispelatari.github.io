<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LatLaysFlat-Part3.asp">Go Check it 
Out</a>. It's an interesting approach to wrapping [insert buzzword] 
functionality in an asp.net control. If you haven't read the first and second 
articles, you may want to read those first. The only drawback to this approach 
for me is the apparent lack of a commercial use license for the google maps api 
(somebody <em>please </em>prove me wrong on this).</p>
