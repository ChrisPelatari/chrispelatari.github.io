title: That's great. It's a website.

Earlier tonight, I showed my girlfriend Tina some of the work I've done, namely [www.velocitydatabank.com](http://www.velocitydatabank.com/) and my most recent endeavor, [Risk Analysis](http://geoweb.velocitydatabank.com/Risk). Like whoa.

It's different showing this stuff to those who are not primarily technically oriented, to say the least. She was slightly impressed, but I think she just said that to make me feel good about myself. That was nice of her.

Has anyone else had experiences like this? I remember showing my mom my company's website when I first rolled it out, and she kind of got this glazed look over her eyes like, wha? Anyways, just thought I'd share.
