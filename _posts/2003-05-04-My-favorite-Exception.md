"Object reference not set to an instance of an object"

I'm not usually one to make my ignorance publicly known.

Okay, if you've seen any amount of my posts [here](http://www.chrisfrazier.net/phoenix) or [there](http://www.dotnetweblogs.com/CFrazier) then you know that's pretty much a lie. I'm learning, right? Well, this is a learning experience for me, and the lesson for today is that the error message at the top of this post is probably one of the few things I hate about .NET.

Sure, it's my code. I've got an error somewhere, and the runtime is telling me "Yo, instantiate the object over here, you moron!" But sometimes I want to pack 5 or 6 objects into a method call because it's easier and I've made something similar work before. "Object reference not set to an instance of an object". Which one, dammit?!?

I would really like it if comments could be posted on my little spin of InfiniBlog(web). But I can't. Why? "Object reference not set to an instance of an object". What a putz I am. *grumble*
