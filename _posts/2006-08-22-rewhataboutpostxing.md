  <p>I love the <a href="http://postxing.net/blog/">PostXING</a> tool and the 
  ability to integrate the playing music. Feature wise they are all about the 
  same though. So it will interesting to see the evolution of the tool.</p>
  <p>One positive out of the project is that I learned a lot about <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=Subversion&amp;FORM=QBRE">Subversion</a> 
  and how to work with it.</p>

<p><i>[Via <a href="http://jazzynupe.net/blog/archive/2006/08/22/775.aspx">It's 
my life... And I live it...</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Well, this post has been a long time coming. What about PostXING? What 
indeed? Well, unfortunately for the 1.5 users of PostXING, I had my son Ethan 
for 6 weeks this summer and spending time with him is 
<strong><em>waaay</em></strong> more important than hacking on a tool that is 
basically useful only to a handful of people. </p>
<p>Then there's the issue of competition: I have always recommended <a href="http://blogjet.com">BlogJet</a> for people that wanted a good solid 
blog posting tool that is way more polished than PostXING (and indeed Windows 
Live Writer) and whose project lead is a really nice, engaging dude. 
Heck, Dmitry even gave me pointers on how to work with mshtml as I was 
writing code that competes with his (guess he wasn't <em>too</em> worried about 
"competition" from PostXING. heh.) And of course the new hip kid on the block 
Windows Live Writer...what can I say? Even <a href="http://tomergabel.com">Tomer</a>, who was gracious enough to help me out 
on developing PostXING, agrees: <a href="http://www.tomergabel.com/PermaLink,guid,8a9d12a0-4eb4-4cf1-aeba-ec956fc8be43.aspx">Windows 
Live Writer kicks ass</a>. The fact that it's free doesn't help the 
situation.</p>
<p>At this point I'm not 100% sure what I want to do with PostXING. I had been 
looking into yet another mshtml wrapper that supposedly handles focus better 
than the code I have, but my experience so far with mshtml is that it's a focus 
stealing bastard child of wysiwyg editing. The good news: you can actually use a 
widget that gives you wysiwyg editing without having to install a browser plugin 
(I'm looking at you, Mono!) The bad news: didn't you read that bastard child 
statement earlier? Geez.</p>
<p>Tentatively what will happen is I will continue to quietly hack on PostXING 
in order to at least bring it out of beta. But I'm definitely going to be taking 
my time on it...I am in no hurry at all.</p>
