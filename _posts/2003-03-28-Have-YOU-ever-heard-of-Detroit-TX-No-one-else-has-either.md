but, that's where I'm going tomorrow. My son lives there with his brother, their mom (baby's momma:), and Nana and Papa (the Grandparents). It's going to be a 5 hour drive, but I'm more concerned about the lack of sleep I think I'm gonna get tonight - I haven't seen Ethan or any of them for 2 months now.

Wish me luck.
