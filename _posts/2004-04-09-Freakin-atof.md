title: Freakin a(tof)!
---
<p>I had some very humble console app beginnings in C++. Ya know, "cash 
register" dos-like programs, completely keyboard driven.</p>
<p>However, my beginnings had nothing to do with converting strings to and from 
floats. I spent a better part of today wondering why atof would not return 
anything but a 0.000000 from a floating-point string. My platform is Windows XP 
- is it clear yet? If nothing else than for my own personal reference, in MFC it 
could possibly be better to use _wtof().</p>
<p>Goodbye first half of Friday.</p>
