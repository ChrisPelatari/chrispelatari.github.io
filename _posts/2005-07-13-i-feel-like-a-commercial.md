but I did switch to geico
and I'm going to save a rediculous amount from my current insurance provider. To
the tune of nearly $2,000 a year. Plus, they took a cue from my current
insurance provider and got <a href="http://geico.com">geek friendly</a>. I did
the whole quote process online and only called after I had a couple of
questions.

I only decided to start shopping around when I learned that when I turn 25 (a
key age for single males in America for car insurance) that I would only get
about $300 off of my current rate <strong>a year.</strong> All I gotta say -
"That's so condescending!"
