title: Cool uses for DHTML

>[Mark](http://mph.homeip.net/journal/) forwarded me a link today of a [site](http://youngpup.net/) that pushes DHMTL to the max. I've gone on record before about my loathing for web development, but I know a lot of you out there are web dev's so maybe you can pick up a trick or two from [youngpup.net](http://youngpup.net/).

<P>I've used some of <A href="http://www.youngpup.net">youngpup's stuff</A>, and 
I must agree with Darren. If you haven't tried it, and you've got a couple of 
different browsers like me, try browsing the site with <A 
href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</A>&nbsp;and then <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp">IE</A>&nbsp;- pretty 
nifty if you ask me. </P>
