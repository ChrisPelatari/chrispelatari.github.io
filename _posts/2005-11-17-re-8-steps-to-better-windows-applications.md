<p dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0;">In an attempt to work on steps 7 and 8
in <a href="http://www.holliday.com.au/blog/2005/10/15/8-steps-to-better-windows-applications.html">Grant
Holliday's Blog</a>, I've started a <a href="http://communityserver.org">community server</a> site for <a href="http://postxing.net">PostXING</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0;">It's lite on content at the moment, (and
also may not work everywhere for the next couple of days thanks to DNS) but
hopefully this will let me address number 7 via the forums and number 8 via the
gallery.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0;">6 is done - actually using the default
browser for the view blog function. I think I'm doing pretty well for number 5,
and number 4 should probably be implemented in a couple of more places. Number 1
is a big duh and should have been done since day one. 2 sounds like an
interesting problem and will require a little more thought (although initially
I'm thinking something like the auto-saved draft feature in
gmail)</p>
