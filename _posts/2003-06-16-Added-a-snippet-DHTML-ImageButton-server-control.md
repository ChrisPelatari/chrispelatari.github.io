title: Added a snippet  DHTML ImageButton server control
---
Thanks to a recent upgrade(?) to this here blog engine, I was able to recover a story I wrote a while back that I never set to "active". It's called [Enter the QuickButton](http://weblogs.asp.net/cfrazier/story/6725.aspx) and it deals with adding DHTML rollover behaviors to the ImageButton control that ships with asp.net.

Enjoy!
