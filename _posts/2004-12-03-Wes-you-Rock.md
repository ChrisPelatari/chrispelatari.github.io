<p>I had been using a different, "static" library to do syntax highlighting 
before...Now, if you don't like how a certain language is configured, change it! 
<a href="http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler">CodeHtmler</a> is great. It 
gives me the option to add or modify language definitions (Generics, anyone?) IF 
I so desire, and it just dropped right into my app with an interface to edit the 
definitions already there. That's HOTT. But (in my best Lavar Burton voice) <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/whaggard/archive/2004/12/02/274133.aspx">Don't take 
<em>my </em>word for it.</a></p>
<p>I changed two lines of code (well, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/whaggard/archive/2004/12/02/274133.aspx">Wes 
</a>did :) in PostXING and it was up and running. I'm not quite ready to release 
the next version of <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a> yet - I've still got a 
little bit of smoke testing to do on the spellchecker, and I just want to make 
sure all the new goodies work before getting angry feature requests on <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">Project Distributor</a>!</p>
<p>So, thanks, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/whaggard">Wes</a>. You have made 
PostXING a better program.</p>
