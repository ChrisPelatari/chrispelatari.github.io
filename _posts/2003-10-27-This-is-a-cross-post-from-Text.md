<p>It seems that cross-posting has become a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/javery/posts/33357.aspx">cool feature </a>since other, more respectedÂ <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">developers </a>have released <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ca70e481-9fbe-4d84-b936-e9db6d84965c">new versions </a>of their prospective blogging engines. </p>
<p>This is a cross-post. You can view this post <a title="My Blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/blog" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="My other blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CFrazier" target="_blank">there</a>. I've been doing it for a while - ever since I got my grubby little hands on someone's blog engine code and was able to play with the source code / webservice combinations that <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">http://weblogs.asp.net</a> exposes. I'm doing it. I know of one other person who's doing it as well. </p>
<p>Anyways, it required a minimal amount of code to achieve - although I'm guessing there is probably a better way to do it, like w/ the MetablogAPI implementation. It's just a webservice call, and I'm able to post technical stuff right up next to <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/posts/208.aspx">non-technical </a>stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll be quiet now.</p>
<p>P.S. One more thing - Thanks to everybody who's blogging the PDC. It's neat to read about what's going on in real-time.</p>
