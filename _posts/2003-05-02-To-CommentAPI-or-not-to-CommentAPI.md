title: To CommentAPI, or not to CommentAPI?
---
I've decided to take an approach based very loosely on the [CommentAPI](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9). I'm not adding the ability to post from outside of the base site yet, but I'm trying to factor this to be as extensible as possible while remaining within the bounds of the original code drop I have.

We'll just have to see how this one goes.
