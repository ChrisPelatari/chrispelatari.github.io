<p>I've needed this link (<!--StartFragment --> <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=11">http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=11</a> 
) a few times, so I thought I'd give it a little google juice so I could find it 
easier next time.</p>
<p>The link is to a widget written by Nikhil Kothari, I'm using it in one of my 
apps currently, and it's really great. Included with a little agility (<!--StartFragment --> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/smourier/archive/2003/06/04/8265.aspx">.NET Html 
Agility Pack: How to use malformed HTML just like it was well-formed XML...</a> 
), this is a tight little package for editing html in 
WindowsÂ Forms.</p>
