title: Movin on up...
---
<p>Tina and I just finished moving the last of our stuff from the old apartment 
to the new one.</p>
<p>We've almost got everything unpacked - I like it here. Thankfully we got most 
everything moved last night, so today was just a few things we carried by hand. 
</p>
<p>Yeah, we moved about 50 yards. The people in the apartment above the last 
place had a washer leak, and we bore most of the consequenses. Half of the walls 
in our bedroom (the washer &amp; dryer connections are in the closet) were brown 
from the leak. So, rather than force us to live in a mold museum, the apartment 
management moved us to a different apartment in the same complex. As if you 
cared. :)</p>
