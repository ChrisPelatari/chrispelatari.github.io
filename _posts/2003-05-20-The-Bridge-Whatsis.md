title: The Bridge Whatsis?
---
The Bridge pattern. All I have to say is..."huh?". Is it me or does this pattern seem like more of an abstract idea than the others I've seen so far? I think I'm going to have to read this chapter again. I don't mind, I'll come back to it.

So why am I reading DPE? Well, it occurs to me that a lot of developers I respect and think of as well-refined in their skills use these terms to not only communicate but also think about development in a higher order. I want that. I'm hungry. I want to collaborate with developers who are much better versed than I am and not just think, "huh?". I've got a lot of work to do.:)
