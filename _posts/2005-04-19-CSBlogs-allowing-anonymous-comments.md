title: "CS::Blogs: allowing anonymous comments"
---
<p>I don't know if this will post with the source, but I've got this link that 
may save someone the trouble of searching CS forums for an answer: <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/479025/ShowPost.aspx">http://communityserver.org/forums/479025/ShowPost.aspx</a></p>
<p>I was wondering why I hadn't been getting any comments lately. Mostly because 
nobody really reads this blog, but even for those other couple of you that are 
subscribed - you couldn't leave a comment without registering!</p>
