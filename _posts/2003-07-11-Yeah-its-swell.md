Of course I did! First, Quake II is one of my favorite games (right up there with Duke Nukem:)...I haven't caught up with the times yet&lt;G&gt;

More importantly, I'm going to be working with some C/C++ code in the very near future, and the example shows both the old and new (I think) source as a means to show how "easy" it is to port from unmanaged to managed code (in C++); there4 I'm very interested in it.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some monsters to kill.;)
