title: Note to the Windows Forms team

<p>Working with windows forms sucks. </p>

<p>Especially if you're coming from the much more approachable asp.net side. I have state, but simple things like pre-selecting an item in a datagrid are not easy - and they should be. You should make me feel comfortable in your environment. Give me a reason to use Windows Forms other than 'it runs on Windows'. </p>

<p>I'm about halfway thru my first Windows Forms project. If I were doing this in asp.net, I would be done by now.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>
