<p> I haven't been to Austin, tx in a while and was craving my favorite<br />
brakfast taco from Juan in a Million, the Don Juan Especial.<br />
<br />
This taco was the subject of an episode of man vs. food, where the<br />
host described how it is prepared, so I figured I'd give it a shot.<br />
<br />
This is what I came up with.<br />
<br />
Recipe transcribed from man vs. food:<br />
<br />
1 Idaho potato, boiled &amp; cubed<br />
"dash" of salt, paprika, black pepper<br />
2 strips of bacon, chopped<br />
2 fresh eggs<br />
<br />
Bring ingredients together in a frying pan on medium high heat, mix<br />
together &amp; cook for 5-10 minutes, scoop onto tortilla, top with cheese.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
