  <p>Anybody else find that MS has so much
  crap going on that it's hard keep tabs on a single, solid,
  resources to use to keep up to speed on things? (And don't even send me to
  msdn.microsoft.com - that thing is 1) schizophrenic (is it a developer
  resource, or a place to buy subscriptions and stuff?) and 2) complete sensory
  overload. )</p></blockquote>

<p>It is pretty worthless unless you are looking for controls - even then, the
contol gallery has broken images and dead links everywhere.</p>
<p>I've found that unlike the asp.net community, it's pretty much yo-yo (you're
on your own) when it comes to winforms development. (and I <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/archive/2003/09/24/184.aspx">complained
loudly about it </a>when I embarked on my first winforms project)</p>
<p><a href="http://CodeProject.com">CodeProject </a>has a lot of interesting
tidbits, but I've yet to find a complete solution in any of the articles there.
Bits and pieces, yes...</p>
<p>Another good resource is the dotnet-winforms list on <a href="http://discuss.develop.com">discuss.develop.com</a>. There are at least
one or two winforms PMs that hang out there.</p>
<p>Lastly, get Chris Sells's book <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/writing/wfbook/">"Windows Forms Programming
in C#" </a>(or VB.NET, whatever.) That book has basic examples of almost
everything you would want to achieve in a normal winforms project. Anything else
is up to google skillz.</p>
