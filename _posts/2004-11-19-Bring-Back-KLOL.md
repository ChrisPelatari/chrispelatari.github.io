  <blockquote><strong>Did you wake up to Spanish music? Clear Channel has 
  decided to make a format change at Houston expense.</strong> Rock 101 KLOL is 
  no longer and we have another Spanish channel to go along with Houston's other 
  16 Spanish channels. We need to show Clear Channel that we will not just stand 
  by while a 32-year-old station is removed from the air. </blockquote></p>
<p>I was devistated. I was listening to <a href="http://waltonandjohnson.com/">Walton and Johnson</a> in the morning, 
and all of a sudden in the afternoon I'm hearing spanish music. If you live in 
the Houston area and give a flying flip (or hell, even if neither apply) please 
visit bringbackklol.com and <a href="http://bringbackklol.com/petition.php">sign 
the petition </a>to bring back one of the best rock stations out there. It can 
be done.</p>
