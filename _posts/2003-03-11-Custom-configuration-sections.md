Too cool Don! Honestly, something like this is going to be my _very_ next endeavor - I'm adding a 'list' type container for my 'QuickLink'/'ImageLink' control. My plan isn't to use a NVC, but rather to hydrate a set amount of controls in an application/page using a custom config handler...this will have to wait a couple of days tho, since I've got to get my Risk app going into an installer by tomorrow :(

Oh well, keep 'em coming, bloggers!
