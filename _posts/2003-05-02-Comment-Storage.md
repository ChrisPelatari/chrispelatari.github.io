This comment stuff is proving to be harder than I thought.

The problem is not the API, which seems pretty straightforward. It's in the way that I will store the comment data on the server. I think that I will follow the model that I have, but it's still proving a bit more involved than I was ready for today on this Friday.

This is going to be one of those things I think that I will end up figuring out in my sleep, waking up and saying "Ah, ha!". Don't lie, you've done it before.:)
