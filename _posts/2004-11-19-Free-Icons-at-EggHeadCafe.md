title: Free Icons at EggHeadCafe
---
<p>I was doing my early morning googling and came across <a href="http://url123.com/ykxzh">this</a> - a set of free icons in the WinXP 
custom format. Really nice if you want to add that touch of candy to your apps, 
be they windows or webforms. There are also a set of spheres there that have a 
slew of different colors...That along with the FireFox extension <a href="http://url123.com/yk7qs">downTHEMall</a> made for a great 5 minutes 
of getting some nice starter icon sets.</p>
