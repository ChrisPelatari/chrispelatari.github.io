Still posting from infiniblog...

I've been sick for the past few days. I hate being sick, it makes me delerious (sp?). Even worse, I'm currently working on a 'rad' project that is making the developer in me cringe. It's really bad.

I'm having to convert a flat table into a 'normal' database, which would be okay but there are a number of fields for each row that require a one to many relationship. So what I've decided to do in the interest of the 'r' part is just throw the logic into a class that loops thru the records to fill the new structure with data.

The data in the original table has some fields with names like A_this and A_that thru M_this and M_that, much like a spreadsheet. This is the part that is making the developer scream "you shouldn't be doing that!!" It's really hard for me to go against my gut feelings, but I suppose that just shows my lack of experience. Not only do I have a cold, but this code is really making me sick.
