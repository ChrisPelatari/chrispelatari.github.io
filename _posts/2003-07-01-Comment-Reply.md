I sure did solve it! Thanks to FreeDOS and fdisk, I wiped my entire machine while I had the time to do so, and reinstalled WinXP, VS.NET, and a very few other proggies I use daily. Unfortunate I had to go that route, but I figured a clean slate was much preferred over wasting hours/days/weeks trying to diagnose a problem that I just couldn't figure out.

Everything works great now. /me knocks wood
