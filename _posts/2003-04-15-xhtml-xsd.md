<P>Where the heck do I get my grubby developer hands on 
this little beast if I can't browse, save in IE? My other browsers (Opera 
6.04/Mozilla 1.0) can't really handle it&nbsp;- opera just chokes and mozilla 
gives me a lot of text...maybe I could still save it as an xsd...I'll be 
back!</P>
<P><FONT color="red">UPDATE: </FONT><FONT color="black">You betcha. I browsed to <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd">XHTML-STRICT</A>&nbsp;and 
selected 'save page as' in Mozilla - bam! I've got it on the Punisher(my dev 
box:)</FONT></P>
