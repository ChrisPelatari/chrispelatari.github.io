title: I want a new...
---
<p>...way to post to my weblogs. Maybe you can help me out.</p>
<p><u>Objective:</u> Create a desktop application that will enable posting entries to a weblog.</p>
<p><u>Technology:</u> Windows Forms, C#</p>
<p><u>Needs:</u> </p>
<ul>
<li>A simple, familiar, WYSIWYG interface for creating content.</li>
<li>Use the MetaBlog API for posting and retrieving content.</li>
<li>Ability to post to many blogs at once.</li>
<li>Ability to save posts locally at the user's discretion and/or in a disconnected scenario.</li></ul>
<p><u>Wants:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>That's where you come in! </li></ul>
<p>I've seen the <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/Gallery/1062.aspx">images of Blogert</a>, but I can't find where to download it :(. It looks like it does almost everything that I need it to do, and it would be real nice to build on top of it to add cross/multi-blog posting. That would be ideal and preferable to starting from scratch. If I can't have my cake and eat it too, I'll just start with what's available.</p>
<p>This isn't really something I <em>need</em>, however it would be really nice to have it, since I'm not completely satisfied with the experience in w.bloggar...I want wysiwyg, just as if I'm posting from my blog itself. So what would be really nice to have on this? I need to sharpen my Windows Forms skills (or lack thereof) - what would be something that would set a tool like this apart a little bit from other software? Or, am I barking up the wrong tree and really need to sharpen my google skills? Thanks for taking the time to read this; I'm off to let this idea stew for a little bit.</p>
