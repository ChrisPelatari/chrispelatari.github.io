title: WhoIs, and my first WinForms Project
---
Yesterday I picked up my first Windows Forms project.

I think it should be pretty lightweight -> it's going to be a data entry app for "API Headers", which is descriptive information about Oil/Gas Well logs. The hardest part I think will be converting the FoxPro Database over to Sql Server - not the data itself, but figuring out where to change what is basically a monolithic table (in spreadsheet fashion) to more normal data. Who knows? Maybe it'll be fun. heh.

In the meantime, I decided to write a front-end to a nice little gem embedded into [aspNetDns](http://www.aspnetdns.com/), WhoIs. I found myself wanting to do whois queries, and sometimes if you use an online search too often, the server will get bogged down - not a fun chore, for me or the server admin. The component makes it extremely easy to do a whois query - it took me 2 lines of code to accomplish it. If you want some more information on that and other utilities like it, ping [Dave Wanta](http://weblogs.asp.net/DWanta).
