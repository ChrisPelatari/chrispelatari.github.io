<p>I saw that <a href="http://thequeue.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,652ae3fa-bad0-4e84-b6df-0a0257549e70.aspx">Jeff 
got things up and running </a>with PostXING (sorry again about the whole 
BlogInfo[0] thing) when I looked at the url. What's this? dasBlog? I never knew 
that dasBlog supported the Metablog API, although I did see the methods exposed 
from its blogger.aspx page. I thought they were just place holders, but I fired 
up my local copy of dasBlog and, sure enough, PostXING can post to it.</p>
<p>WordPress also supports the metablog API - hopefully subText will retain that 
feature of dotText so there will be at least a few blogging engines (I know of) 
that you can set up for a personal blog and post to with <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>.</p>
<p><font color="red">update</font>: It seems it was a fluke on my end, but I have 
an older version of dasBlog. It sure looks from Jeff's post that it works with 
whatever version he's running...</p>
