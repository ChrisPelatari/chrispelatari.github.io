<p>And now I can post there with <a href="http://postxing.net">PostXING</a> (v2).</p>
<p>Dare has put up a <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=50920c46-f405-4f8f-85b3-6c2d18330c64">couple 
</a>of <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f7a05332-7838-40ed-bcc2-af2667f79a77">tutorials 
</a>on how to setup Metablog support for w.bloggar and BlogJet. Since I 
"borrowed" ideas from both of these fine applications, the setup for w.bloggar 
is nearly identical to what you need to do in PostXING v2. Sorry for those v1 
folks, I don't think it'll work in that version. Maybe I can put out a patch so 
that v1 will work too.</p>
<p>I'd also like to thank <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare</a> for being so helpful in 
the beta stage. He personally replied to my questions and gave insight on a 
couple of things that were very helpful (like the BOM thing, which may or may 
not be a fluke in the beta version of spaces)</p>
