<p>Go to the Admin section of your blog, and in the “Custom CSS Selectors” textbox add:</p>
<pre>main {
margin-left:200px;
padding:0px 20px 0px 0px;
width: 580px;
}
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>It still has a bit of gap-osis, but at least your main content will end up where it does for IE. I haven't tried this out on Opera yet, but I've implemented it <a title="My Blog" href="/blog" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="My other blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CFrazier" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>
