So how's about a project I haven't goofed up yet?

I started to make a little headway on the UI of Miny, my first WinForms project. Miny is the name given to the project because a change in the data structure requires a "one to miny" relationship, whatever that is&lt;G&gt;.

All I really have to say at this point is wow - the [MagicLibrary](http://www.dotnetmagic.com/) is a must-have if you're developing WinForms. It comes with sample source code, and thanks to that and a helpful [Example by Lutz Roeder](http://www.aisto.com/roeder) (sp?) with a similar library, I hit the ground running with some VS.NET - style menus including images.

nice.
