  <p>A few weeks ago I wanted to release an update to my own blogging engine 
  and, because there was a minor data change I thought that it would be 
  nice to export the data before running the update, change the files and then 
  re-import it afterwards.  As I looked into this more I decided that I 
  really should do it in a standards-compliant manner (if possible) and so then 
  set out to: A) talk to people about it, B) rtfm some of the existing formats 
  and C) write down my requirements.</p></blockquote>

<p>Very seldom does someone come along who has simple ideas that can work 
coupled with what it takes to make those ideas reality. Darren is one of those 
people.</p>
<p>BlogML may not be the best thing since sliced bread, but it's an idea that is 
brilliant in its simplicity. Why should a task - importing and exporting blog 
content - be shoehorned into a spec that was never meant to do this in the first 
place? Isn't that the reason that atom was designed itself? To rehash the 
failures and stick with the successes of past specifications dealing with 
blogging? So is BlogML IMHO to import/export of blog content.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, Darren. Although we live on opposite sides of the 
globe, you are always welcome to ping me with these crazy ideas of yours, if for 
nothing else than to talk them out.</p>
