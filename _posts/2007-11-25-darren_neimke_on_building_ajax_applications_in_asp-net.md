<a href="http://showusyourcode.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!15630F96CB7D86C1!532.entry">Darren Neimke talks about building ajax applications, both with and without a button to intercept.</a>..Darren has this way of explaining things in a way that always makes me nod my head in agreement. Thing is, I haven't really had the opportunity recently to hack a lot in asp.net. It's easy to forget with all of the ajax content on the net that essentially, it's just javascript that interacts with asp.net and other web frameworks really well. Thx, Darren.
