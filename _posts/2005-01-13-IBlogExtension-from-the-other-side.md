title: IBlogExtension, from the other side
---
<p>I can now use the great <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/plugins">IBlogExtension plugins for NewsGator</a> 
to post with <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>. (with my 
built about 10 minutes ago dogfood version, that is :) Thanks for that 
idea, <a href="http://rosscode.com">Joel</a>.</p>
<p>The only problem with this method is that it's "push only" - I can only 
publish with these plugins. No history management, and strictly speaking, not 
manageable on the same level as using the Metablog API. So, I can't set an 
account for IBlogExtension blogs - no navigating to the site without manually 
opening a browser, basically no integration with the current UI. Categories seem 
to be up to the plugin as well. <a href="http://bluefenix.blogspot.com/2005/01/iblogextension-from-other-side.html">But 
I can post</a>. That's one step in the right direction, right?</p>
