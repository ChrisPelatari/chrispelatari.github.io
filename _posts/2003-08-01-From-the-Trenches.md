Adding to [others who have stated it](http://scottwater.com/blog/posts/9207.aspx), I'd like to congratulate [Alex Lowe](http://weblogs.asp.net/alowe) on his new position at Microsoft. I spoke with him directly about this, and got the above quote in response to a discussion about some Evangelists that I've met (not [that one](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/), he's actually pretty cool in person) getting out of touch with what's going on "In the trenches".

The quote alone makes me confident that Microsoft has made a wise decision. Good luck, Alex!
