<p>I wanted to install the newest version of Konfabulator to one of my 
computers, so I went to <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com">www.konfabulator.com</a> and tried to install 
the latest version (3.0.1 earlier today, 3.0.2 this evening) but instead of 
getting the 11MB download that the site reports, I get a little &lt;500KB file 
called widgetsus.exe. </p>
<p>According to some forum posts, I'm not the only person having problems here. 
My problem was that no computers that didn't already have an earlier version of 
Konfabulator would actually install off of this file. So I looked thru a few 
more forum posts and found a url to 3.0.1 (<a href="http://us.dl1.yimg.com/download.yahoo.com/dl/widgets/us/yahoowidgets3x77.exe">http://us.dl1.yimg.com/download.yahoo.com/dl/widgets/us/yahoowidgets3x77.exe</a>) 
and was then able to guess for the 3.0.2 version (<a href="http://us.dl1.yimg.com/download.yahoo.com/dl/widgets/us/yahoowidgets3x79.exe">http://us.dl1.yimg.com/download.yahoo.com/dl/widgets/us/yahoowidgets3x79.exe</a>) 
these are the files that the web installer are <em>supposed</em> to download, 
but don't. </p>
<p>Hopefully me posting this won't tip off the developers and make them choose a 
different naming scheme. Better yet, why not just let end users download the 
installer instead of <em>having</em> to go thru the web 
installer.</p>
