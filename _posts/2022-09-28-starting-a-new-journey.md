I started a new job yesterday.

It's great to start a new journey and I'm so excited for what this new job has in store for me. They trusted me from the get-go by giving me a laptop and two monitors. ngl I felt a bit nervous at first - this is my first job change for 21 years - but as soon as I got a whiteboard session and saw some of the code I will be hacking, it quickly turned to excitement. 

I'm ready to get to work and show them what I'm made of. ✈️
