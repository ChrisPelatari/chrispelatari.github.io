<p>Okay, I'm pretty solid on the <a href="http://www.windowsforms.com/ControlGallery/ControlDetail.aspx?Control=290&amp;tabindex=9" target="_blank">HtmlEditor</a> that I'm going to use for my little side 
project. It's a sweet editor. Honestly, it has more features than I think are 
necessary in this case, but that's okay with me.</p>
<p>On to the topic at hand. Originally, I spec'ed the <a href="http://www.squishyweb.com/ware/products.asp?q=squishysyntax" target="_blank">Codify</a> option to be in a dialog because that seemed like 
a nice tradeoff. I also tried a method that would allow you to either type code 
into the design surface or copy/paste it from <a href="http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/" target="_blank">your favorite 
editor</a>, click a button, and bam! it's formatted. Seems like a winner, 
but the problem is that when you copy/paste into the editor, you lose 
tabs/spaces.</p>
<p>So how would you like it to work?</p>
