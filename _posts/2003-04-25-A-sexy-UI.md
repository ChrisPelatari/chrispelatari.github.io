>The world must be about to end. [Jeffrey Zeldman has an RSS feed](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0403a.shtml#fed) and [Chris Pirillo has a weblog format without a stupid font.](http://chris.pirillo.com/secret/) Now if we could only get Chris to do a weblog without a stupid font and without a totally sexy photo as the background. I find the photo more distracting than the font. Just don't tell my wife, OK? Oh, hi Maryam! :-)

Chris, I've got to hand it to you for creating a [UI that will keep users interested](http://chris.pirillo.com/secret/). 

Oops, was that supposed to be secret?;)
