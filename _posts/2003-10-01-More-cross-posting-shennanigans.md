title: More cross-posting shennanigans.
---
I think I'm going to play with .Text a little bit to allow cross-posting from <a title="My Blog" href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog" target="_blank">here</a> to <a title="My other blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CFrazier" target="_blank">there</a> using w.Bloggar and the MetaBlog API.

Perhaps there are some hidden jewels in <a href="http://www.dasblog.net/">dasBlog </a>that I could borrow the idea from...just thinking out loud.
