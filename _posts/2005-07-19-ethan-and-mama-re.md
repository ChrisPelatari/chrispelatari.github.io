Welcome to the poor man's vblog...a link with text :) I took this video on my digital camera the other day. It's 2:41. I thought I'd post it up here so I can search on it after Ethan becomes a teenager to remember "the good ole days". It's a little dark, and Ethan is totally oblivious to what I'm doing. He actually thinks I'm getting ready to take a picture, I believe. Anyways, here it is: <a href="http://www.bluefenix.net/videos/Ethan071705.MPG">Ethan071705.MPG</a>
