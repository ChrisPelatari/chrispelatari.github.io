title: Added HTTP Request code snippit
---
>I'm adding a new category of posts to my blog; *code snippits*.  I was looking for a tool to manage code snippits when it hit me, why not post them to my blog.  I hope you find them useful.  I'll just randomly post stuff up there as I work on it. 

>There are a couple problems with this.  One - the editor forces each line of code to have a <p/> break, so the code looks unweildy.  Two - Some of the code spans methods within a class, and I'm not quite sure how to post that yet.  I'll give this stuff some thought and hopefully have a fix soon.

>For now, the first one is self-contained and was easy to post, it's an example of how to do a HTTP request and you can find it here.

Good idea, Don. I recently asked [ScottW](http://www.aspnetweblogs.com/) if I could post kind of psuedo-articles to the story section of my blog, and his response was, "Yes. Definitely". I haven't gotten around to it yet, but only b/c of my hoakie dial-up connection (28.8 kbps) I have at the heezie \[trans.:house, residence\] So, hopefully if things go my way today, I'll have a little sumthin-sumthin to post up in my story section later today. If not, I'll just haveta settle for tomorrow.

Procrastination? Na, I'll procrastinate later.
