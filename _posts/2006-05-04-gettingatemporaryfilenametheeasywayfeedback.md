  <div class="comment_content">Path.GetTempFileName() guarantees that you will get 
  an available name, it does actually go ahead and create the file so it is 
  guaranteed to be yours when you use it. If you strip the extension off and 
  substitute your own you may end up overwriting an existing file. Not a smart 
  thing to do.</div></blockquote>
<p>In my case, I just really want the filename. Whether or not I change the 
extension, that file is <strong>mine </strong>to do with what I will. Also, 
since it's not in the same folder as the originating file, it can be the exact 
same name, extension and all, and it will still be a different file that what 
was generated by the framework. I <em>should </em>take care of file cleanup, and 
that zero byte file <em>is </em>still in the temp directory...</p>

  <div class="comment_content">Be aware the GetTempFileName() actually creates a 
  zero byte file in the temp folder. Your code will leave the temp file behind 
  in the temp folder. If you use that a lot, you will end up with a lot of files 
  in the temp folder.</div></blockquote>
<p>true! So, maybe I was a little quick to post about this one, but it was one 
of those things that struck me as particularly useful. If you just want a 
temporary filename, and want to clean up the file that is created by 
GetTempFileName(), perhaps this will work a little better:</p>
<p></p><pre><span style="color:blue;">string</span> GetTempFileName(){
	<span style="color:blue;">string</span> filename = Path.GetTempFileName();

	File.Delete(filename);

	<span style="color:blue;">return</span> Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(filename);
}</pre>
<p>
</p><p>Okay y'all...rip it to shreds :) If I've missed something else obvious, call 
me out. Or, if you have a preferred method of generating temporary file names, 
show the way.</p>
