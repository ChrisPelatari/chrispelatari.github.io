<p>Darren's <a href="http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=823c0159-e081-46a7-ba96-b212aed5df26">looking
for ideas </a>on how to migrate data from one blog engine to the next. This has
been discussed before a lot, I'm sure, but it's not a bad conversation to
have.</p>
<p>So what's the answer? Sorry, I don't have that. I know that it would have
been nice when developing <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a> to have an api that
gives you more control or gives better querying ability, and I also know that
none of the APIs that Darren talks about are it. For all of the metablog api's
shortcomings, I find it at least decent enough to not have made a post using the
web interface of my blogs since writing PostXING. I agree with Darren that the
atom api does not seem complete. No categories? That's weird. If you're worried
about being different from rss in some small way (and come on, that's what it's
about in the first place, innit?) call them "labels" or "tags" but give me a way
to categorize my thoughts. Please.</p>
<p>One person whose thoughts I'd like to hear on the idea of a better blogging
api is <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog">ScottW</a> who has written a
few external apis for different evolutions of the popular aspnetweblog software
that we all know and love and call <a href="http://communityserver.org">CS::Blogs</a> these days. <img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" align="baseline" border="0" /></p>

  <p><strong>A better blogging API</strong></p>
  <p>I'll also do some searching over the next week or so to see what others
  have been discussing around this topic as it is obviously something which must
  have come up a lot.  Maybe we have to wait until industry heavyweights
  start to build blogging products into their core platforms before clear spec's
  start to emerge around what is needed from an API that would allow for the
  programmatic disovery and interaction with blogs.  </p>
  <p>And then, who knows how long it will take for the current blog engines to
  implement that?</p></blockquote><i>[Via <a href="http://MarkItUp.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=823c0159-e081-46a7-ba96-b212aed5df26">MarkItUp
