title: What's in a name?
---
<p>In my comments <a title="My Blog" href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://karavshin.org/blogs/black-coffee/archive/000474.html">Michael Slater</a> says I should try out zempt for my blog-editing pleasure...well, I went to the site and thanks for the suggestion, Mikey, but I think that zempt only targets MT, which this blog is not (thank you Jesus...and ScottW:)</p>
<p>So, I've been thinking of what I should name my little side project, and I thought you could help me. I've asked this same question elsewhere, and here's a little list of what has been suggested so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>BlogPost</li>
<li>BlogPoster</li>
<li>Blogster</li>
<li>Hi-Lited-Blog-Poster</li>
<li>Poster Face (like poker face:)</li>
<li>POSTERIOR</li>
<li>Sharlene</li>
<li>Sally</li>
<li>PostThoughts</li>
<li>PostBloggem</li>
<li>POST-it (can I get sued for that?)</li>
<li>POST-Code</li>
<li>POSTAL (as in I'm going)</li></ul>
<p>I was thinking something that included a play on the word post somehow, since that's what I'm calling entries to my blog. Of course, I'm witholding the names of the suggestors to protect my a$. But here's the thing - I just want a fun name for my project, and I think you can help. The above are okay, but fun? I'm not really feelin it. If I can't come up with anything within a day or two, I'm going to cave in and call the finished product <strike><a href="http://www.nmr.ru/dasha.html">Dasha</a> </strike> Post-it. Thanks!</p>
