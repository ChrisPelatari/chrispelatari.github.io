title: How bad do you want spellchecking?
---
<p>Well, I've implemented it. I figured out a way to have a user-defined 
dictionary location (very simple implementation), but now I'm still facing the 
dilemma of where do I point to for the dictionaries? Like I said before, the <a href="http://www.loresoft.com/Applications/NetSpell/default.aspx">NetSpell 
</a>component comes with a few dictionaries by default.</p>
<p>OpenOffice has a project called lingucomponent that has a more <a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html">exhaustive listing of 
dictionaries</a>, but they are not in the same format that NetSpell uses. (I 
even tried using the en_US dictionary. Needless to say it was useless as it 
stopped on every word.) However, there is an article for NetSpell about <a href="http://www.loresoft.com/Applications/NetSpell/Articles/246.aspx">creating 
a custom dictionary</a>, although I don't know, looking at the contents of the 
files together, if that will be of much help at all.</p>
<p>Either way, it looks like it might require a download of the NetSpell 
software for the included dictionaries and the dictionary build tool. What do 
you think?</p>
