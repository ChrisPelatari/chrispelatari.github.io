<p>I just added <a href="http://geourl.org">geoUrl </a>to my blog. I don't know why I didn't thing to do this before! I just have it pointing to my personal blog that has the correct tags, so when you click on the link it queries the database based on the url <a title="My Blog" href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog" target="_blank">here</a> not <a title="My other blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CFrazier" target="_blank">there</a>. </p>
<p>Nice. There's also this <a href="http://www.brainoff.com/geoblog">site which has a world map </a>on it and shows up where you are if you make a post. </p>
