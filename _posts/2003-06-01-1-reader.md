Heh, I've got 3 readers now.

Someone pinged me and said the link in my previous post doesn't work. Sorry bout that, it won't be "live" until Monday at the earliest. Also, it requires login/registration with [Velocity Databank](http://www.velocitydatabank.com/) reason being it is targeted at a very precise audience - namely Geologists/Geophysicists and soon Oil & Gas Engineers.

We have some other [Exploration Tools](http://quicklook.velocitydatabank.com) that don't require login as well. I guess it wouldn't seem that exciting if you weren't some sort of GeoTech, tho.

cya.
