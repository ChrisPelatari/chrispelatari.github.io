<p>My girlfriend Tina just pointed me to a site that a friend of hers has put up - <a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/tx/hannahgrace/index.htm">Hannah Henson</a>Â is a young lady who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma earlier this year after she broke her hip.</p>
<br />
<p>If you could, would you both go and <a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/tx/hannahgrace/guestbook.html">sign her guestbook</a>? She's still reading this site while she's with us. Thanks.</p>
