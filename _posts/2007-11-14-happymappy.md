<p>As a thanx you to <a href="http://www.morewally.com/">Sir Wally</a> for  kicking me in the butt to start blogging again, I'm linking to a site he told me  about called <a href="http://www.happymappy.com/">HappyMappy.com</a> that he is  involved with. I did a search on <a href="http://www.happymappy.com/HappyMappy.aspx?mapid=89fff2c6-fa14-444b-87bf-594c94bb7035">sports  in the Houston area</a> and was surprised to see "Htowns Arena Theatre" in the  results. That's hood, Sir Wally. It makes my mappy happy :P</p>
