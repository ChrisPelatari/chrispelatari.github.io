<p>It wasÂ pretty easy, I used some code that I modified from the original 
<a href="http://squishyweb.com/ware/products.asp?q=squishysyntax">SquishySyntaxHighlighter 
</a>component written by <a href="http://www.surrealization.com/">Adam 
Sills</a>. The original code uses lots of [span style=] tags, and even uses 
javascript to collapse/expand #regions if you're using code written from Visual 
Studio.NET. I modified it to use mostly [font] tags and 86'ed the javascript, so 
it would show up in an aggregator better.</p>
