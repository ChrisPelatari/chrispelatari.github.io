title: New PostXING release
---

I've gone ahead and uploaded a <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.1.5017.1">new build of PostXING</a>. I 
extended the plugin architecture a little bit to allow for posting to non-.Text 
blog engines using IBlogExtension plugins, of which there are a few out there 
already. Everything else is pretty much the same, but I had to give out some 
credit for the plugin architecture - I didn't come up with that stuff on my own 
and I'm all about giving credit where credit is due.

To test this IBlogExtension plugin architecture (really all you have to do is 
drop the IBlogExtension dll/exe into PostXING's plugins subdirectory) I created 
a <a href="http://bluefenix.blogspot.com/">blogger account</a>Â that I could 
use the <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/plugins/default.aspx">NewsGator 
blogger plugin </a>to test against. Guess what? <a href="http://bluefenix.blogspot.com/2005/01/new-postxing-release.html">It 
works</a>.
