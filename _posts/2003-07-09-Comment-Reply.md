>You can buy the upgrade for vs.net 2003 for 29$ even if you have a vs.net 2002 you got with an MSDN subscription that is no longer valid. The license of that vs.net 2002 is still valid thus you are entitled to buy the upgrade.

Thanks Frans. This would seem like a good idea, except that I'm in the middle of a couple of projects being built w/ VS.NET 2002. Would an upgrade mean that I will now have only 2003? I'm not sure, so I'm not going to upgrade just yet.

Thanks for the tip, tho!
