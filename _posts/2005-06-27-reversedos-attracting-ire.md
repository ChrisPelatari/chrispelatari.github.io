<p>I'm seeing a little trend - I delete comment spam as soon as it gets to any 
of my weblogs, so I don't have any hard numbers - posts that I have written 
about Mike's <a href="http://angrypets.com/tools/rdos">ReverseDOS</a>Â sure 
<em>seem</em> to be getting targeted by comment spammers. I don't see this in 
the <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog">blog that has ReverseDOS 
installed</a>, but instead at <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cfrazier">the one 
hosted on weblogs.asp.net</a>.</p>
<p>What they don't know is that I have comment moderation turned on, so no 
comments make it thru without my say so. I wonder how many layers of defense 
will be required before I no longer have to worry about comment spam?</p>
