title: A new feature...
---
<p>...for <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING </a>that I should 
have added a long time ago. It only took roughly 40 lines of code (including 
gratuitous whitespace). I'll give you a hint on what it is:</p>
<p><img alt="" hspace="0" src="/assets/images/loadorsavepost.gif" align="baseline" border="0" /></p>
<p>There are a couple of other things that I would like to implement before 
uploading a new release, tho. For example - I don't see a good reason why you 
shouldn't be able to post/publish/cross post from the preview pane. Also, <a href="http://rosscode.com/Blog/index.php">Joel Ross</a>Â gave me the 
spectacular idea of using <a href="http://newsgator.com/plugins/">existing 
IBlogExtension plugins</a> to make posting to blogs other than .Text or some 
other Metablog API enabled blog engine not only possible, but extremely 
easy.</p>
