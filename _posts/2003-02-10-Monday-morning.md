title: Monday morning...

<P>What better to do on a Monday morning than find out which type of OS your personality is matched with? Makes you look nice and busy, and from the other blogs I am reading, [<A href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/DNeimke/archive/02102003.aspx#2110">Darren</A>] , [<A href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/DBrowning/archive/02102003.aspx#2149">Don</A> ] , and [<A href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.rss">Sam</A>] have taken the quiz...so why can't I?</P>

<P>Well, I turned out to be OS2 - <A href="http://bbspot.com/News/2003/01/os_quiz.php"><IMG height="90" alt="Which OS are You?" src="http://www.bbspot.com/Images/News_Features/2003/01/os_quiz/os2_warp.jpg" width="300" border="0"/>Which OS are You?</A> </P>

<P>Other than that, it's back to the old 'interop blues' for me. I've got to get this asp.old porting project done so I can move on to something that I can innovate with - something with style, ya know?</P>

<P>-Respect.</P>
