This was a switch I didn't even know existed from the command line. I was having some issues with VS.NET 2002 and custom Add in tools. I couldn't figure out why I could see the name of the tool in the Add in manager list, but I couldn't see the tool in the Tools menu.

Enter Dave Wanta, one of the coolest developers I know. I asked him, "What's the deal?" and without even missing a beat, he gave me the suggestion that is the title for this entry, and WOOT! There it is! If you haven't seen [Dave's Site](http://www.123aspx.com/) you're either living under a rock, or you could care less about .NET and aren't reading this anyway. Dave is also responsible for such components as [aspNetEmail](http://www.aspnetemail.com/), [aspNetDns](http://www.aspnetdns.com/), among other really useful tools for .NET.
