title: ATM - Galaga
---
I had a dream last nite that I was going to an ATM to get some cash. When I was at the terminal, on the opposite side of the English/Espanol options there was a third option - Internet. What? so, of course I chose Internet - this could be fun, right? 
  
The screen pops up with a clone of Galaga - you used the keypad to move and one of the option buttons to shoot. I was just about to reach my high score when I noticed the long line of people behind me. Whoops :) I guess I can beat my high score anytime - preferrably around 1 AM.
