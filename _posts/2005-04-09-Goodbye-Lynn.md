title: Goodbye, Lynn
---
<p>One of my coworkers, Lynn Coyle, was found dead in his house this morning. 
</p>
<p>Lynn had diabetes. He was kind of an odd character, but he was a good person. 
I often joked around with him in the office - he had a strange sense of humor, 
but we got along pretty well.</p>
<p>I knew him for a little over 3 years, and in that time I learned a few things 
about him: he was a good geophysicist, with a specialty in borehole research. He 
served in the army when he was younger. He doesn't have much family left. He 
took care of his neighbors. For me, personally, he was there to talk about the 
things that he knew and he taught me lots about the oil &amp; gas industry.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Lynn, you will be missed.</p>
