Also, thanks [Scott](http://www.aspnetweblog.com/) for the simpleblogservice...I think this will be the way to go, of course using post to put new entries in based on an infiniblog bit. I've got to check with [Chris](http://objective.mine.nu/), but I think I will make the code available for download on my site...once I get more than just a blog working there, of course:P!

The modifications I've made are simple yet important \[to this geek anyway\] and include identifying a blog by virtual directory (which is what must be happening in this here blogspace) and geoUrl service via geo.blah meta tags - it works, it's cool, and I saw my personal blog show up on the map over there. Too cool. I have other plans here, too - I just got this damn day job thing that makes me put on my thinking cap sometimes. Maybe it's time to get into the zone.;)
