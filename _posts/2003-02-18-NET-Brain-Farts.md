title: .NET Brain Farts
---
Today Seems like an extended Moday as far as my development goes. I've tried about 3 or 4 different tings on my current project that just don't seem to be working as I would expect them to. Of course, that's the point, isn't it? I've had a few brain farts in my past development cycle, all of which ended up being just oversights on my end - you know, the type of thing that really bites you, and then when you figure it out, you let out a resounding "d'oh!".

Well, I guess the only thing I can really do is keep plugging away at it, maybe a solution will surface. Till next time - blog ya later.
