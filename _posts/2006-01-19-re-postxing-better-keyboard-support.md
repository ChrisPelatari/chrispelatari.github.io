<p>Heh, oops. This is what happens when the tool that you are building is the 
same tool you are using to make tech notes to yourself.* Really, there should be 
a bugtracker in place so that I can have a central organized spot to have bug 
reports, feedback, etc.</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions? I've used (and liked) gemini, but delusions of 
granduer aside the 10 user limit gives me pause. I want <a href="http://postxing.net">PostXING</a>Â to remain free, so any supporting 
items like this need to be free as well.</p>
<p>*yes, most of my notes do look like this.</p>
