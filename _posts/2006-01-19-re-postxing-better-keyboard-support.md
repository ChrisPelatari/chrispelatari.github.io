<p>Heh, oops. This is what happens when the tool that you are building is the
same tool you are using to make tech notes to yourself.* Really, there should be
a bugtracker in place so that I can have a central organized spot to have bug
reports, feedback, etc.</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions? I've used (and liked) gemini, but delusions of
granduer aside the 10 user limit gives me pause. I want <a href="http://postxing.net">PostXING</a> to remain free, so any supporting
items like this need to be free as well.</p>
<p>*yes, most of my notes do look like this.</p>
