title: So VB.NET just ain't that bad after all.
---
Hit a new "milestone" in my current project today, at the same time really starting to understand where the term "over-engineering" is founded - of course, from engineers.

Background: I'm adding features that were requested by engineers onto the [Risk Analysis](http://geoweb.velocitydatabank.com/Risk) project. Basically, there are 4 components that help clearly define what is known in the Oil&Gas Exploration industry as Recovery Factor - How much oil or gas do we think we're gonna get?

They're bullISH. From an end-user (who may be an engineer) perspective, tho - these things are important. So I get to learn VB.NET.

The original component used to make the calculations and the associated graphs was written about a year and a half ago in VB6. Since the move to .NET, we decided that it would be a good idea to upgrade the VB6 code to VB.NET. So far so good, but guess what? I'm a C# programmer :S

So I'm not finding VB.NET that difficult to work with, as a matter of fact, I'm kinda digging the compatibility namespace since it's letting me leave a goodly amount of the code alone. Actually, if I stick with the fx to do my bidding, the code is looking structurally identical to the code that I write in C# (not aesthetically or syntacticly) heh! go figure.
