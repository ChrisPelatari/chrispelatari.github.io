title: A couple of releases

<p>So I released a <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.1.4363.1">new version 
of PostXING</a>Â , adding support for the new IBlogExtension plugin I was 
talking about the other day. Oh, I <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/plugin1.0.4365.1">released the 
BlogThisUsingPostXING plugin</a>, too. </p>
<p>I think I mentioned that I got the large part of the source code for that one 
from <a href="http://haacked.com/">haacked</a>, but if I didn't, I am now. The 
source is in no way original by me, I just hacked the solution from his <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/12/04/1697.aspx">improved plugin for using 
w.bloggar with RSS Bandit</a>. </p>
<p>To use the plugin, the latest version of PostXING is required - it writes out 
the location of PostXING so everyone knows how to play nicely together and also 
takes in (kind of) an html file for adding post information to PostXING on load. 
Sorry about that - I had no idea how to get this working before I got this great 
code sample from haacked. I'm sure that neither one of you will mind that much, 
tho.</p>
