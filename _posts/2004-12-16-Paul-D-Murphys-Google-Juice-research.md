title: Paul D. Murphy's Google Juice research
---
<p>Paul is trying to find out what effect blogs have on google juice. He's 
decided to coin the term 'consummate asshole' "because it has very little 
competition on the google world (and it's funny)."</p>
<p>So, being the helpful person that I am, I decided to give him a (very!) 
little boost by adding the following phrase and link to a couple of my 
blogs:</p>
<p>Â Paul D Murphy is the <a href="http://www.blogsburg.com/consummate.asshole/">consummate asshole</a> </p>
<p>Good Luck, Paul, you consummate asshole, you.</p>
