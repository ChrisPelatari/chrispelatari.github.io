Well, it's been a week now since I handed over my pip-squeak back to his mom.

I gotta say, I miss him a lot. Having him around every day and then all of a sudden not having him any more is a real shock to the system. I've also gotta say that I feel really blessed to have been able to spend that time with Ethan, and do fun Father/Son stuff. By far the most fun that I had was when I took him to the beach for the first time <em>ever</em>.

I tought Ethan the basics of doing a jig after you throw down a football. Ethan taught me that you need a bucket of water to wash each hand when they get sandy at the beach: <a href="http://www.bluefenix.net/videos/Ethan072405.MPG">Ethan072405.MPG</a>
