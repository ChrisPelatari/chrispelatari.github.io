<p>I recently did my semi-annual "house cleaning", where instead of just getting 
rid of all the accumulated crap I've got on my dev box, I repave and start over. 
I did this with the idea that I wouldn't install anything without needing it 
first. Heh, maybe I can keep my start menu down to one column this time ;).</p>
<p>So the need arises for <a href="http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/">CodeSmith</a> - I need a custom 
collection, and I want to do it from VS.NET. Well, I head over to my \bin 
folder, and there's codesmith, waiting with a .bat file to re-register itself in 
VS.NET (vsnet2003_register.bat). I didn't have to reinstall, I just ran the 
batch file and I've got a custom collection. Thanks, codesmith
