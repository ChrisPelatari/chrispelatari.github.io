<p>I've got weak regex skillz. I'll admit it. </p>
<p>I don't use them very much, so when I do need to, it's nice to know that 
regexlib is sitting there, waiting for me to come to it with my regex needs. In 
particular, there is an online <a href="http://regexlib.com/RETester.aspx">Regular Expression Tester</a> that 
has helped me to look smarter than I actually am on more than one occasion. 
Sure, I could use a desktop tool for my regex needs (and sometimes I do), but 
regexlib has the added bonus of having a collection of user-contributed regular 
expressions that are super useful when looking for ideas on how to implement a 
certain regex. </p>
<p>And let's not forget the <a href="http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx">Cheat 
Sheet</a> ... regexlib is just chock full of regex goodness.</p>
