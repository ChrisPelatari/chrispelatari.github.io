A big, fat, hairy, resounding NEGATIVE! I'm all for connectivity and all, but as Andrew points out, what a productivity killer! My day usually starts out going thru a bunch of emails, writing some code, opening my aggregator, writing some code, repeat. No way. VS.NET would never get opened if I had a single spot for information transaction.
