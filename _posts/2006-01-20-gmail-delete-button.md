<p>This was the <strong>first</strong> thing that I requested from gmail, and 
they've taken it up a notch - instead of only deleting messages, it notifies you 
if there are messages in a current "conversation" that have already been 
deleted:</p>
<p>Â  32 deleted messages in this conversation. <span class="lk" id="str">View 
messages</span> or <span class="lk" id="dlf">delete forever</span>.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
