# 🏴‍☠️ The Declaration of Snugland 🏴‍☠️

Be it known to all ye hearty souls, scallywags, and pillow-fort enthusiasts!
*Whereas* the sun doth rise and set upon the softest of cushions, and the moon doth cast its silvery glow upon our fleece blankets, we, the merry band of Snugglers, do hereby declare this land, this haven of coziness, as the sovereign nation of Snugland!
## Article I: The Right to Cuddle
Every snug-loving soul shall have the inalienable right to snuggle, cuddle, and nestle within the borders of Snugland. No cold feet or chilly shoulders shall go unattended!
## Article II: The Pillow Code
The Pillow Code shall be our sacred law. It states: “Thou shalt fluff thy pillows, plump thy cushions, and arrange thy throws with care.”
*Any* violation of the Pillow Code shall be met with a stern look and a gentle reminder to maintain fluffiness.
## Article III: The Fuzzy Border Dispute
Our borders shall be marked by a fuzzy line of marshmallow clouds and feathered quilts. Any attempt to cross said border without proper snuggle credentials shall be met with a tickle fight.
## Article IV: The Snuggle Tax
All citizens of Snugland shall pay their dues in marshmallows, hot cocoa, and bedtime stories. Failure to comply shall result in banishment to the Land of Uncomfortable Chairs.
## Article V: The National Anthem
Our anthem shall be a lullaby sung by a thousand plush teddy bears. It goes like this:
> 🎶 Snugland, Snugland, where dreams are spun,
> Under the quilted moon and the fleecey sun.
> We wrap ourselves in warmth and glee,
> Forever snug, in sweet serenity. 🎶

## Article VI: The Snuggle Council
A council of wise grandmas, fluffy kittens, and retired pirates shall govern Snugland. Their decisions shall be binding, as long as they’re made from rocking chairs.
## Article VII: The Snug-o-meter
We shall measure our prosperity not in gold doubloons, but in snuggles per square inch. The higher the snug-o-meter reading, the happier our land.
*In witness whereof*, we raise our mugs of cocoa, our fuzzy socks, and our hearts full of warmth. Let it be known across the seven seas: Snugland is here to stay!
By the power vested in us by the Great Blanket Fort in the Sky, we hereby declare Snugland an independent micro-nation. May our nights be cozy, our mornings lazy, and our dreams as soft as freshly laundered pajamas.
Long live Snugland! 🌟🛌🌙
