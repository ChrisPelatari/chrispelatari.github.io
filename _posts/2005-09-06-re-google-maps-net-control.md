  <p>Check out this code project article with code for a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/LatLaysFlat-Part1.asp">Google Maps
  .NET control</a>. very cool and handy stuff. and there are some demos <a href="http://www.sctc.state.co.us/dev/GoogleMaps/">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I read thru that, and it seems very useful to be able to manipulate things in
codebehind like that. Once the lat/lon overlays are included, I may even check
it out. </p>
<p>In other mapping news, I was contacted recently by the mappoint webservice
team b/c I haven't made any requests to the webservice for a while. I told them
that the current webservice doesn't buy me a whole lot in terms of functionality
from the current solution that I use that simply has a mapserver control on my
webserver and asked if virtual earth may be rolled into the webservice (since
virtual earth currently only has licensing for non-commercial apps). They didn't
tell me one way or the other, but my mappoint account was reinstated. Could this
mean virtual earth goodness on the horizon? I hope so.</p>
