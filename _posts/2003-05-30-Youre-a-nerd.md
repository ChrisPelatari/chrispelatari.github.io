title: You're a nerd.
---
Last night I couldn't go to sleep, so I hopped on my laptop @ 1:00am.

The funny part is,  when my modem stopped hand-shaking, one of my favorite ['softies](http://objective.mine.nu/) popped up on Windows Messenger.

I won't go into a lot of the exact things we discussed as I don't know how this person feels about personal disclosure, but I can tell you my initial thought and thus my initial message to him:

"You're a nerd."
