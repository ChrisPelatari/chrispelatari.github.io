<p>Okay, so I haven't posted for a while and you don't care. Established. </p>
<p>But you've gotta check this out, for real. <a href="http://blackcoil.com/">Francesco Sanfilippo</a> has been putting in 
work on <a href="http://www.url123.com">www.url123.com</a> , an asp.net link 
shortening solution.</p>
<p>Right, there are a lot of them out there, but this makes it so easy for me to 
shorten a url...I don't have to have the site open or even remember the name. 
How do I do this? Easy - bookmarklets.</p>
<p>A bookmarklet is one of those things that is so simple, it's beautiful. 
Scenario: I'm chatting with someone on msn messenger, talking about <a href="http://nunit.org">NUnit</a>. The nunit-gui comes up in the conversation, 
and I want to point them to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jsgreenwood/archive/2004/08/16/214901.aspx">this 
post</a> but decide that the url is too long for the messenger output. 
Since I've <a href="http://www.url123.com/Tools.aspx">already added the 
bookmarklet</a>, instead of this person seeing this [ <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jsgreenwood/archive/2004/08/16/214901.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/jsgreenwood/archive/2004/08/16/214901.aspx</a> ] 
they see this [ <!--StartFragment --> <a href="http://url123.com/hsz4u">http://url123.com/hsz4u</a> ]. </p>
<p>All I did was hit a button on my browser! That's it! 
nice...</p>
