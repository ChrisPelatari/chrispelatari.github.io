<p>And I know it. I haven't updated the binaries on <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">ProjectDistributor </a>for a long time 
because I've been taking my time writing v2. Thing is, it's starting to <a href="http://www.holliday.com.au/blog/2005/10/15/offline-blog-posting-with-blogjet.html">catch 
up to me</a>.</p>
<p>PostXING v1 is far from polished. It works well enough for my needs and I 
made it available for download in the hopes that it would be useful to someone 
else, nothing more. But I do want to make it a better application, and that's 
where you, dear reader, can help me out a little bit. I've decided to release an 
early alpha of PostXING v2 in the hopes that doing so will help it suck less 
than v1.</p>
<p>What's in it for you? Well, the same thing that's in it for me: if you catch 
some nasty behavior that I've missed then PostXING becomes a better product for 
everyone who uses it (all two dozen of ya) </p>
<p>If you're interested, <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog/contact.aspx">contact me</a> with 
the subject "PostXING alpha request" and I'll send you a zipfile with the new 
bits. The program requires v2 of the .NET framework. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
