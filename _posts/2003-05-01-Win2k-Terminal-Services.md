title: Win2k Terminal Services.
---
I'm pretty sure no one was paying attention  (even me:), but I made a post a while back about using Terminal Services as a sort of Software KVM.

Well, I've been using it to administer webservers at work and it works great. Getting it to work over the internet is a different topic -&gt; I haven't even scratched the surface of using the Advanced Client, but I may have to look into that option.

At any rate, I found this great document on "[Securing Microsoft Windows 2000 Terminal Services](http://nsa1.www.conxion.com/win2k/guides/w2k-19.pdf)"...if you're using termServ. at all, it's at least worth a quick run-thru. Plus all the pages that say 'Unclassified' make it kind of interesting.
