<P>Okay, it's not as if anyone is reading this - but for those of you who are (hey, Chris!) - here is why I didn't post yesterday. </P>

<P>I've been working with <A href="http://www.datadynamics.com/ARNET/default.htm">DataDynamic's ActiveReports for .NET</A> on my current project. It's a pretty cool report engine, and I was able to set up an export in PDF format with a lot of ease. I prefer this product over others right now because it integrates well within the VS.NET IDE, which is my weapon of choice. I'm working on getting the output formatted the way I want - I'm trying to get a bunch of 'textboxes' to look like a table/datagrid - but this stuff ain't html.</P>

<P>Anyways, thanks for reading, Chris. I've got to report back to reporting. caio!</P>
