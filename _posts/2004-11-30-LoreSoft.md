<p>I feel like I've hit .net developer's gold.</p>
<p>I was searching for a spell checking component and came across <a href="http://www.loresoft.com/default.aspx">this site </a>(with the help of <a href="http://dev4net.com/Blog/Default.aspx">Don Smith</a>). Not only is there a 
spell checker component there (which looks pretty good at first glance) but 
there are a bunch of other useful tools ranging from a Windows API file search 
wrapper to web access for Visual SourceSafe and Draco.NET.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm hoping to add spell checking and a couple of other items to <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>. If you'd like to snag a 
copy, you can find the latest release <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.0.4335.1">here</a>.</p>
