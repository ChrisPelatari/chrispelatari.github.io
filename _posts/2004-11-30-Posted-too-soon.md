title: Posted too soon?

It looks like I created (or rather raised an awareness to) a little 
snafu on <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">ProjectDistributor</a> :/

The <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.0.4335.1">latest release </a>of <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a> didn't upload properly, 
so I'm putting a temporary download on my server: 
PostXINGv1.0.4335.1.zip 

<p><font color="red">update</font> - it's fixed!</p>

I also rolled back the release to the last one that worked as a download over 
at <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">ProjectDistributor.net</a>.

I'll be taking both down as soon as Darren lets me know things are well 
again. Sorry to both of you that care.
