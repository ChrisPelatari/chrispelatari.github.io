<p>I know I've figured out a fun song when my left hand hurts after
playing. That hasn't happened for a loong time.</p>
<p>I was playing my guitar, trying to soothe the pain that the Astros getting
swept in the World Series ignited, when I came across a chord pattern that
sounded familiar: Am, G, [whatever's between G and F], F, E. To check if I was
right, I looked it up: <!--StartFragment --> <a href="http://www.guitaretab.com/l/led-zeppelin/10185.html">Led Zeppelin – ( BABE
IM GONNA LEAVE YOU TAB )</a> </p>
<p>This is going to take a while to master, but it's definitely going to be a
fun ride.</p>
