Ah, the joys of writing open source software :/

I had been working hard on v2 of <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a>, but somehow development has
stagnated on my end quite a bit. I brought it about 90% of the way towards the
direction I was hoping to go. I even got an offer of help from a fellow
Houstonian, but it seems I've dropped the ball. My bad.

Fortunately, as I said I've completed most of the grunt work, now it's just a
matter of gluing everything together and creating a different provider than the
Metablog API. It was still evolving when I last hacked on it, so I may only be
85% done, but at any rate, if I can get that fire going back under my ass I
should be done in no time. I hope :D

Since nobody but me is clamoring for v2, I can at least take my time and do
things the way I want them. It's nice to be able to work on a software project
without any stinkin time constraints. Another pitfall is that the latest v1 rev
works well enough that I haven't felt the <em>need</em> to develop v2. I just
<em>want</em> to. I want to make PostXING a better program. We'll see how it
goes.
