So I decided to move the location of my blog, using <a href="http://scottwater.com/dottext">dotText</a>. I was going to wait for a while, but the Image gallery feature has me sold. Sorry, Chris, it's been a while since I've heard from ya and well, I want comments, dammit! That's partly my fault, as I haven't had the time or the knowledge to figure out how to make that particular feature work. So, no bad karma thrown that way:)
