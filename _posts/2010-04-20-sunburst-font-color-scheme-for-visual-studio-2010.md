<p>Here is a clone of the TextMate theme "Sunburst" for Visual Studio 2010: <a href="http://bluefenix.net/etc/blue_fenix_sunburst_lite.zip">http://bluefenix.net/etc/blue_fenix_sunburst_lite.zip</a></p>
<p>I just guessed on the colorsÂ since I had to translate from mac colors to 
windows, but the result is pretty effective for me. enjoy!</p>
<p>update: I changed the colors to use the actual rgb values from 
textmate.</p>
