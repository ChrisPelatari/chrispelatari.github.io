<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jalexander">Jason Alexander</a> <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jalexander/archive/2003/12/16/43894.aspx">posted recently </a>about moving <a href="http://www.ngallery.org">nGallery </a>to <a href="http://vaultpub.sourcegear.com">VaultPub</a>.</p>
<p>I'm hosting my little slow-going side project there too (hence the title:) It's going to be a WYSIWYG desktop blog editor that will allow posting to many different blogs - if they support the MetaWeblog API. I had originally called it PostModern, at the suggestions of <strike>one of my readers</strike> a passer-by, but I'm changing the name to Post XING, since the main point of this little app was to allow me to post to different blogs if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've got to say that Vault / Vaultpub is really awesome. It's been quite some time since I've used source control, and the last solution I used (VSS) taught me how to cope with loss. I'm even testing it over a dial-up connection (I know, that's SO 1994) and it still works great. Sweet.</p>
