Too funny. I try to post mainly .net related findings, and enjoy relatively low traffic here other than the occasional google or yahoo search on "object reference...".

All it takes is a nearby Texan to post about one thing non-dotnet...and I've gotten a bunch of hits about my potty humor. I'm not that good a programmer, anyway:)
