Okay, the last one didn't go thru - still trying to sort the logic. *sorry again, Scott*.

This is great stuff, tho. I've learned more about xml-rpc/webservices (and the difference b/t them)/rss in the past couple of weeks than I've learned over the past year or two in dealing with all things .NET. And it's not someone just telling me how great it is (read: marketing)...if I can see it, rather or do it myself, then I can make the decision of whether or not I like it. 

Verdict? Cool beans.:)
