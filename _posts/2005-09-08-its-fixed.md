<p>Yesterday I realized that I was having issues with anonymous users posting 
comments to <a href="http://chrisfrazier.net/blog">my CS site</a>. After going 
over the code a little bit, what I didn't realize is that the bug is a 
<strong>custom skin bug. </strong>(ie a skin that I wrote was missing one line 
containing a specific control.)</p>
<p>After a little searching I found someone with a similar problem, and <a href="http://callmealex.com/default.aspx">Alex Lowe </a>pointed them here: <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/491886/ShowPost.aspx#491913">http://communityserver.org/forums/491886/ShowPost.aspx#491913</a></p>
<p>And it worked. Yay.</p>
