I took Ethan and my cousin Cody to the beach today. I got them some du-rags
and ninja swords, so they could play pirates. They had a sword fight on the
ferry ride to crystal beach.

I was even able to get a resounding "Arr Matey!" out of Ethan

When we were at the beach, we did what everyone should do at the beach every
once in a while. We buried each other. We probably should have gone from biggest
to smallest, but we started with Ethan.
