title: Stupid error messages.
---
<p>I could have sworn I saw this on someone else's blog recently, but I just 
encountered a pretty dumb error from a hiccup on this very server.</p>
<p>I've recently added a new server to our network that will ultimately be a DC 
(did I mention I hate network administration?) so I decided to make this server 
"headless" - only admining it from VNC or RDP. Well, when a reboot was 
necessary, I found a nice little message on bootup (by plugging the KVM back 
into this server) that said "Error - Keyboard not found. Press F1 to continue or 
DEL to enter setup."</p>
<p>So...how am I supposed to do this when there is NO KEYBOARD? Heh, it was just 
mildly annoying - but since it was easily recoverable, I'm able to laugh about 
it not even 30 minutes later.</p>
