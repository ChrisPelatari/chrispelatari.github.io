This was the error that was biting me on PostXING v2 for almost a week (I
usually only get insomnia hours to debug. That can be frustrating.)

The first thing that I noticed was that the wonderful interfaces that I was
using would end up null after my first visit to a particular configuration page.
It's something about the way that a "Page" is saved and loaded - it requires
ViewState! Forreal! I'd gotten so used to having state within my smart clients
that I had almost forgot about reconstructing state.

Now that I had that taken care of, I was getting an exception returned from
what seemed to be the service endpoint of the metablog api. But wait a second -
I'm using nearly the same code in v1. So I think, hey, I'll go ahead and use
exactly the same code from v1 and put that in there - that'll surely work,
right?
<pre><span style="color:blue;">using</span> System;
<span style="color:blue;">using</span> CookComputing.XmlRpc;

<span style="color:blue;">namespace</span> PostXING.MetaBlogProvider
{
	<span style="color:gray;">/// &lt;summary&gt;
</span>	<span style="color:gray;">/// BlogRequest wraps the blogger api getUsersBlog xml-rpc method.
</span>	<span style="color:gray;">/// &lt;/summary&gt;
</span>	<span style="color:blue;">public</span> <span style="color:blue;">class</span> BlogRequest : XmlRpcClientProtocol
	{
		<span style="color:blue;">public</span> BlogRequest(){	}

		[XmlRpcMethod(<span style="color:maroon;">"blogger.getUsersBlogs"</span>,
			 Description=<span style="color:maroon;">"Returns information on all the blogs a given user "</span>
			 + <span style="color:maroon;">"is a member."</span>)]
		<span style="color:blue;">public</span> bgBlogInfo[] getUsersBlogs(<span style="color:blue;">string</span> appKey,<span style="color:blue;">string</span> username,<span style="color:blue;">string</span> password) {
			<span style="color:blue;">return</span> (bgBlogInfo[])Invoke(<span style="color:maroon;">"getUsersBlogs"</span>,<span style="color:blue;">new</span> <span style="color:blue;">object</span>[]{appKey,username,password});
		}
	}
}</pre>

Nope, same exception (the title of
this post). After the dent in my head grew to about three inches, I decided to
look at the version of <a href="http://xml-rpc.net">xml-rpc.net</a>Â that I
was using. Hmm, 0.8. What version was the endpoint using? Double hmm, 0.9. Could
it be a simple version mismatch that was my problem giving me this cryptic
error?

Yep.</span>
