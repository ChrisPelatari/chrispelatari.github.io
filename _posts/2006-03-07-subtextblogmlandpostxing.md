This is the end result after setting up <a href="http://subtextproject.com/">SubText </a>and importing my old blog (now <a href="http://chrisfrazier.net/cs11">moved to here</a>). I had created a blogML
exporter for <a href="http://communityserver.org">cs11</a> and ran into
some initial problems because the version of <a href="http://blogml.com">BlogML</a> I had used was a smidge older
(v0.9) and therefore had a different schema. Kinda makes me wish there were
a way to clear out all the content and start over like <a href="http://projectdistributor.net/Projects/Project.aspx?projectId=131">subv2
</a>allows me to.

So why didn't I go with subv2? (Sorry, <a href="http://markitup.com">Darren</a>) The admin interface and WebParts' silly
requirement of IE. I basically live in <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a> and although it's been quite some
time since I've posted thru the web interface of .text/CS::Blogs, I do need to
go in from time to time and make some changes. Plus, since subtext was forked
off of .text, I'm already pretty familiar with the interface (and some of the
code when necessary). Subv2 is a real nice exploration of all the fun new
doohickeys in .net 2.0, and with Darren at the helm you know it's high-quality
stuff, but I need something that works for me in the environment I choose to
work with. Either way, I've got an install of Subv2 behind the firewall so I
could just make that one public and import my shiny new blogML file if need be:
I'm keeping a definite eye on it, that's for sure.
