I've upgraded [bluefenix.net](bluefenix.net) and changed it up a little bit. The copy that was there previously turned out to be custom lorem ipsum content. I still have some copy to figure out but I'm very pleased with the outcome so far.

In the process I upgraded to bootstrap 4 and the latest fontawesome. It's fun to keep my web properties up to date and it helps with potential clients in the future. Expertise > time.
