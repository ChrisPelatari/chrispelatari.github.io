<p>I'm about to start cracking on this issue, but I'd love to get a little
feedback on it before I put it into code. If either of you have an extra minute,
shoot to the url above and leave a comment. I normally don't solicit feedback
like this, but I kind of feel like I'm missing something. Although I could just
be thinking about it too much. Either way, help a code munkey out if ya can
