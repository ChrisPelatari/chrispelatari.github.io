title: The Tao of Programming

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <h3 align="center">1.2</h3>
  <p>The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the 
  assembler. 
  </p><p>The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand 
  languages. 
  </p><p>Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the 
  Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao. 
  </p><p>But do not program in <tt>COBOL</tt> if you can avoid it.
