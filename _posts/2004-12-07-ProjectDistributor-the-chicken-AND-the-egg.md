<p>Well, it looks like <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke">Darren</a> decided to confuse the 
hell out of me and make his <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">Project 
Distributor</a> available for <a href="http://url123.com/zyz7y">download</a> at guess where? <a href="http://url123.com/zyz7y">Project Distributor</a>! Okay, maybe it's not 
that confusing (or maybe I just confuse too easily :)</p>
<p>This is great news - ever since I've made <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING</a> available for download at <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.0.4335.1">Project Distributor</a> I've 
had nothing but great things to say about the service...and now I can have it on 
a server all my own! Cheers, Darren, for coming up with a great idea and making 
it available to everyone. You rock.</p>
