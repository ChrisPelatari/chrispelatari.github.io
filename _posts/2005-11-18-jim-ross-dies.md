Our prayers are with you, Jim. I only
met Jim in real life one time, and he gave me a ride to my hotel on my first
visit to Washington. He lived 5 hours away from me, but we had to go to another
state to meet in person! Even though I didn't know him very well personally,
it's funny the repoir you build with folks you communicate with often. Most of
the Insiders I've come in contact with have just started talking as if we had
seen each other just a few days ago. Jim was just like that.

This is a sad day in Texas.
<blockquote>I was sad to hear that fellow ASP
Insider and ASP.NET MVP Jim Ross died peacefully yesterday from his
cancer.

He told us all about his illness
earlier in the year, then carried on posting answers as if nothing had
happened. His last post on the email lists I frequent was just 10 days ago.

Funeral information:

The funeral will be Monday at 2 pm at Tyler Memorial, 12053 Hwy 64W, Tyler,
TX 75704; 903-597-1396. Visitation is Sunday, 6-8pm

<em>It is with heavy heart that I inform you that my beloved husband, Jim,
died today around 4:30pm. When he awoke this morning, he was too weak to get
out of his recliner. I called the hospice nurse and she came right over. She
made arrangements for Jim to be transported to Hospice Home Place. I called
Ron Dart and he was here with me when the ambulance came at 10:30am to
transport Jim. Jim was able to talk with both Ron and me. He said he was ready
and he hoped his time would be short. God answered his prayer. Jim took a turn
for the worse in the ambulance and never regained consciousness. I was alone
with Jim, holding his hand, when he died...it was very peaceful. Praise God.
