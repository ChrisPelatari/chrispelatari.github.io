It started when I saw a piece from the underbelly project NYC by <a href="http://joeiurato.wordpress.com/">:01</a>.

It inspired me. I think it's beautiful. So I made a <a href="http://instagr.am/p/nCCrW/">transparency of it</a> to cut my own stencils.

<img class="alignnone" title=":01 transparency" src="http://distilleryimage6.s3.amazonaws.com/3b4404624d4e11e180c9123138016265_7.jpg" alt=":01 transparency" width="612" height="612" />

This is my first piece. I'm using Joe's art as a guideline. I think I may switch up the words a bit since my living room has no upstairs. :) (not pictured: it says "the people upstairs are crazy")

I hope that my reproduction honors the original work, and conveys the respect of the student to a very talented mentor. I will post more pics of my progress soon.
