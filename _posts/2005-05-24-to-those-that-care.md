<p>I.e. Both of you...I've changed the repository structure of <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/main">PostXING </a>on <a href="http://vaultpub.sourcegear.com">vaultpub </a>to better facilitate 
branching.</p>
<p>These crazy new ideas I've been having are so different from the current 
architecture of PostXING that I have to branch it just in case someone comes to 
me with a nasty bug they found that I just overlooked (this has happened a few 
times already, although not for a while). I don't like having broken software 
with my name on it out in the wild.</p>
<p>Anyways, I thought I would keep tabs on my progress for this on my blog. I 
feel like there is something that I'm missing in the ideas that I'm having, so 
I'm taking this slowly, step by step. To be honest, I've always had this idea in 
my head for PostXING. It's why it's built the way it is - I've left 
extensibility points open at the expense of writing a bit more code on the 
onset. When I'm done, a developer that has a good handle on the API they want to 
post to will be able to author a plugin/provider, drop it into a subdirectory 
off of the application root, and be able to use PostXING as kind of a shell to 
post to their custom API.</p>
