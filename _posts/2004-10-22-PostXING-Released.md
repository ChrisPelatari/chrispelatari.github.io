title: PostXING Released.
---
<p>I finally released my <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.0.4294.1">little 
home-hacked tool </a>to the wild, Thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke">Darren </a>and his awesome <a href="http://markitup.aspxconnection.com/">Project Distributor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.0.4294.1">PostXING </a>was originally 
just something that I wanted to use to see what I could successfully do in the 
world of <a href="http://windowsforms.net">WindowsForms</a>. I never intended to 
release it forreal because who needs another desktop blog editor, right? Well, 
I've been successfully using it for months now, so I figured, why not share the 
love?</p>
<p>A lot of people helped me along the way, and they're indicated in the about 
dialog. Big shout out goes to <a href="http://scottwater.com/">ScottWater</a> for showing the way initially 
- a lot of the codebase was inspired by a similar tool that he wrote. Another 
shout out to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/whaggard">Wes Haggard</a> for 
helping me get the latest feature in - I extended his idea a little bit as I 
tend to do.</p>
<p>So if you still don't have a WYSIWYG desktop blog publishing tool, and 
you have .NET 1.1 on your machine, or you wanna just check it out - find it <a href="http://PostXING.url123.com/v1.0.4294.1">here</a>.</p>
