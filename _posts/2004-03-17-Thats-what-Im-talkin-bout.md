<p><a href="http://www.3deurope.com/Blog/default.aspx" target="_blank">Julien 
Ellie</a>, you rock. In response to all the WinForms hubub yesterday, I asked 
for a higher limit on the file selection dialog (you can only select about 200 
ATM). Julien said in my comments:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Well, I see that a KB article (820631) says this behavior is by design so I 
  don't know how much freedom we have here. You'll understand that I can't 
  promise anything, I am just a dev, but I'll make sure to look into it and ask 
  questions about this. Thanks!</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">That is so slick. Julien, you may be just a dev, but that my friend 
is the correct attitude to have about it. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, the only workaround I've found is enabling drag n 
drop onto a listbox for file selection from explorer. [edit]</p>
