<p>I'm sorry, reader. </p>
<p>I haven't posted to this thing in almost 2 months, and I'm sure that both of you are quite upset at me. So what's been going on with me lately? Let's see...</p>
<p>I started a little side project for posting to my blog from my desktop with a wysiwyg editor. I decided to stop working on it a week or two ago. Why? Well, there are a few tools out there already that let you do this very well, so I pulled resources on it for unoriginality reasons. You still want a wysiwyg editor? Try <a href="http://www.blogjet.com">BlogJet</a>. This is the one that made me say “it's been done”. There is no way that I could dedicate the time to make my little tool do anything super-cool that would make it a viable alternative, and it looks like no one but me wants to post to more than one blog at a time. Shame.</p>
<p>Other than that, I've been working hard at the day job. “Smart Clients”. That's taken a lot of my time - I ain't no WinForms programmer :).</p>
<p>So, thank both of you for staying subscribed to me. I appreciate it, and I'll do my best to keep the content coming to you, desktop publishing tool or not. </p>
