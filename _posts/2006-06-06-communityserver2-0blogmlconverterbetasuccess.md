I'm a little bit behind on my CS releases, as I just got around to installing
a fresh copy of Community Server 2.0 to test things out for one of my sites.
Since I was going to upgrade an existing CS 1.1 install, I tried that method
first, but ended up starting over because the original config I had was single
blog and I didn't have the time nor the patience to figure out how to hack 2.0
into a single-blog install with existing content.

However, thanks to [Keyvan](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/02/11/491.aspx)Â (che
khabbar!), I was able to export the 1.1 content using an HttpHandler I hacked up
for exporting CS 1.1 content to BlogML and import into a new, multi-blog install
of 2.0. The first thing I did was nuke both the sample weblog and the sample
weblog group. Then I created a new group and weblog and used the application key
assigned to the new blog to import my posts. Here is the code I used to import a
blogML file into a fresh copy of Community Server 2.0

```ASP
<%@ Page Language = "VB" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "System.Collections" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "System.IO" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "BlogML" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "BlogML.Xml" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "CommunityServer" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "CommunityServer.Components" %>
<%@ Import Namespace = "CommunityServer.Blogs" %>

I hacked up this file in WebMatrix and slapped it into the webroot of my new
CommunityServer install. This way I was able to copy the content to a local install before pushing the final product out intoÂ the wild, and I didn't have to recompile any of CS to get it working. Merci, Keyvan!
