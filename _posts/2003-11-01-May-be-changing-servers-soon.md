title: May be changing servers soon...

<p>I may have to change servers...it looks like another app that lives <a title="My Blog" href="/blog" target="_blank">here</a> is timing out a lot and I want to be able to make sure it's not my blog's fault.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE</font>: It's not my blog's fault, thank you very much. It turns out to be some over-sorting in one of the libraries the other app is using. Time to refactor, baby.</p>
