  <p>Since announcing that we've started 
  the beta of our implementation of the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblog API</a> for <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/">MSN Spaces</a>, I've received a bunch of 
  positive responses from a couple of blogging tool developers. So far it looks 
  like there'll be at least six blogging tools users will be able to use to 
  manage the blog on their space after we launch the API. </p></blockquote>

<p>Add at least one more - PostXING v2 will work with MSN Spaces via the 
MetaWeblog API. I don't think that it will work well with previous versions 
because I had to change some code in <a href="http://xml-rpc.net">xml-rpc.net</a>Â to handle the BOM as I noted 
earlier. If the xml-rpc.net library was updated for v1, I'm sure it would work 
there as well.</p>
