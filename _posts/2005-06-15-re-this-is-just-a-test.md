<p>Nice! Lookin good, Don! I personally have had firewall issues with FTP (what 
a beast!) and have yet to find an opensource SFTP (ftp as a subset of ssh) 
solution, which does work on my server. One of these days I'm going to beef up 
my firewalling skills and let the stinkin ftp traffic thru. </p>
<p>Anyways, glad to see you "back in the game" :)</p>

  all of its plugins, and configured the FTP support. If this post is 
  successful, I (and you) will know I'm good to go.</p>
