excerpt: instead of fighting with hidden directories to keep git flow functional with github for windows, I've decided to just simplify.

## What is github flow?
I will let [them explain that.](https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser) I guess the basic idea is to simplify the way git flow encourages you to organize branches. 

I'm glad that I [know how to install git flow](http://chrispelatari.github.io/2013/07/07/git-flow-and-github-for-windows/) and I like the structure that it enables, but simpler is better.
