title: I had to blog this.

<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Mozilla FireFox </a>as my default browser for a couple of weeks. I love it - for the most part. A lot of people don't design for standards, though. They design for what is <em>the</em>  standard, ie IE. Therefore, a lot of sites that I may browse from time to time really look horrible in mozilla, and I find myself opening IE and dragging a link there just to make sure my eyes haven't permanently squinted.</p>
<p><a href="http://ieview.mozdev.org/">Those Days Are Over</a>. Meet IEView, a “brain-dead simple” plugin for FireFox, but so effective I just know I'll use this every day. From the site:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><!--StartFragment --> The ieview plugin is a simple Mozilla and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> extension (for Microsoft Windows systems), which allows the current page or a selected link to be opened in Internet Explorer. I use Mozilla 99.99% of the time, but there are those moments -- particularly when testing new pages, or when viewing that rare IE-only page that's actually interesting -- when I need to see what things look like in IE. </p></blockquote>
