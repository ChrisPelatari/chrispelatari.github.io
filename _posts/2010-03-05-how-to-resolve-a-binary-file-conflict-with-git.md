<p>Thank you for that!</p>
<p>Although the message at the end of git status says use git checkout -- 
&lt;file&gt;, that's not it.</p>
<p>"If you prefer to resolve the conflict using their copy, you need to get the 
version of the file from the branch you were trying to merge in:
</p><p /><pre>git checkout otherbranch somefile.dll"</pre>
<p>
</p><p>sweet.</p>
