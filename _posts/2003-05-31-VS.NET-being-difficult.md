title: VS.NET being difficult...

Uh-oh. I did a little finishing touches to my latest application, [Risk Analysis](http://geoweb.velocitydatabank.com/Risk)  and it looks like Visual Studio doesn't like something I've done lately.

It took about 3.5 minutes to build/compile a 6 page ASP.NET project. That ain't good. So it looks like I'll be spending Monday doing some spring cleaning on the Punisher. Oh boy.
