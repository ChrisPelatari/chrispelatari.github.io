<p>Just to let both of you know - I'm expecting some downtime this weekend for 
<a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net">www.chrisfrazier.net</a> . See, I live in 
Houston and we've got a little storm coming our way. Since I host my site on my 
own on-site server, that means that I've got to unplug it and put it in a room 
with no windows. Ya know, just in case.</p>
<p>So now you know whyÂ my rss feed won't work this weekend. Don't you just 
feel all squishy inside now? As for me, I'm heading to the hill country for the 
weekend. Just in case, feel me?</p>
