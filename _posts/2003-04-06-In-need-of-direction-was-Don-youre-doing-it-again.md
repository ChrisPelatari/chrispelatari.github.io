I sent over a similar email...I guess I should have blogged about it, but I'd be surprised if there was anybody subscribed to my blog.:P Very surprized. I wanted to see what I could do to implement a blog on my site which I probably should link to but won't b/c it has a cheezy "coming soon..." default page up now and is begging for me to add content. How 'bout it, Chris? I need direction....:)

Update - You're 100% right, Andrew. My bad - consider it snipped.
