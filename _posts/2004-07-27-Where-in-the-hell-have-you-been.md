title: Where in the hell have you been?
---
<p>Short answer: working.</p>
<p>Longer answer: I've been learning so much lately that my brain hasn't had the 
rest period required to post faithfully to this here blog. Sorry about that. So 
what have I been learning? I've been learning about lerp (linear interpolation) 
bilerp(bilinear interpolation) and slerp (shperical interpolation).</p>
<p>I'm dipping my foot into the waters of 3d imaging, and it's not an easy thing 
to learn. Not always, anyways. I've also picked up a (gasp) BSD firewall project 
(using <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>)Â that has me learning not 
only <a href="http://openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html">pf rules</a>, but also the 
*nix environment. Working without a gui is very Tao. Thanks cd and ls. </p>
<p>One thing that I've noticed about this whole posting often thing is this: 
when I'm working with <a href="http://asp.net">asp.net</a>, I tend to post more 
often. I guess this is because I'm pretty comfortable in this area and it gives 
me more time to reflect on what I've been doing. When I'm learning something 
new, forget about it. Working on <a href="http://windowsforms.net">WinForms</a>, 
forget about it. So, hopefully I can get back into the swing of things and post 
more than once a month...:) Thanks for being patient, I appreciate 
that.</p>
