title: Generating Ideas...

I've decided to try and make my life a little easier. Controls. I've jumped into them a little in the past, but now I may have a little more time to put some extra thought into it. What I would like to do is encapsulate client-side behaviors like .htc's or javascript components and wrap it up in a drag-n-droppable asp.net server control. This leaves open a lot of possibilities...so I guess now is the time to generate ideas.
