<p><a href="http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=Gino_in_a_word_GHETTO&amp;tab=weblogs&amp;uid=73175147">My 
cousin finally got a weblog</a> but I can't subsribe to it! </p>
<p>I sent these people an email asking them to at least include permalinks and a 
<em>public</em> rss feed. You have to join the site to do anything, even sign a 
<strong>guest</strong>book. </p>
<p>I wasted a good part of an hour trying to find somewhere on the site that I 
didn't have to sign in to, and ended up sending the email to <em>abuse.</em> 
oops. </p>
<p>So am I wrong to want permalinks and an rss feed? Or should I tell my cousin 
to choose another provider?</p>
