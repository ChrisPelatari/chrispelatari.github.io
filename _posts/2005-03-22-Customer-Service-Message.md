title: Customer Service Message
---
<p>This is a message that my boss recently sent to a customer that had an issue 
with one of our software packages (I don't own it :)</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>Brian, in the finest tradition of Microsoft, VDB's engineers have returned 
  an error message  that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem at 
  hand.   Time Steps should be in the range of 1 to 10.  Instead, 
  of limiting the input (1 to 10). VDB's fine engineers, it seems, prefer to 
  give a worthless message, then plow on with  a 10 millisecond 
  TD-Chart.  I conclude, the only reason for this is that they are trying 
  to kill me.   I will have the problem fixed.   Maybe we 
  will replace all messages with one that says "Call Tom, we are trying to kill 
  him, sorry for any inconvenience."</p>
  <p>Anyway, I have attached a new release 2.8.4, it has some new features like 
  ZOOM, Undo, and a way to graph Well markers (horizons). It will also launch 
  the help guide from the help button, now there is a novel ideal.  Though 
  not fully tested, I'm sure it has an entire new array of useless error 
  messages designed to kill me.</p>
  <p><br />Sorry for the problem</p>
  <p><br />Tom</p></blockquote>
