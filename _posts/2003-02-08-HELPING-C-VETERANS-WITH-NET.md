title: HELPING C VETERANS WITH .NET
---
My boss asked me to come into work today to explain accessing a database in .NET to one of our developers who mainly codes in C. It was pretty interesting - this guy is an amazing programmer, but as I said mainly codes in C so is a .NET novice. I was able to explain dataAdapters and dataSets in a way that a C programmer would understand - pretty neat-o if you ask me.

I'll be the first one to tell you that I have not reached a level of programming to be able to say - "I am THE programmer!", but I know .NET fairly well anyway. Today I explained one of those cool .NET aspects to someone who probably can say he is THE programmer. Has anyone else done something like this?
