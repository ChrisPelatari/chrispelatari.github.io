<p>I took a week off from reading blogs last week (as is evidenced by my 
responding to week-old posts). I ended up having about 600-700 unread posts in 
RssBandit.</p>
<p>The UI took care of it pretty well, since I have my opml separated by 
category I could zip thru most posts and decide whether or not I wanted to keep 
it around in the aggregate view. It got me thinking about how this would scale 
for a web app, tho. I don't remember how Bloglines handles this (don't you just 
get what's available at the time if there are unread feeds available?) but it 
seems like an interesting problem: how do you keep a rich experience in a web 
app without sacrificing performance or content that I may want to read (mark all 
read is not always optimal for me (I always feel like I'm missing something 
golden (I <em>did</em> subscribe to the feed, after all)))?</p>
