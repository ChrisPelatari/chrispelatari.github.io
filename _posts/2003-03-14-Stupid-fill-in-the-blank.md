title: Stupid [fill in the blank]
---
<P>I've been working today with <A 
href="http://www.fpoint.com">farpoint's spread for webforms control</A>, trying 
to make it act like you would want a spreadsheet to work. I've been focusing on 
the copy/paste functionality at a user's request...it's more difficult than I 
wanted it to be, but maybe I'm just being lazy, thanks to <A 
href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/ERobilliard">Eli </A>and his <A 
href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/ERobillard/Story/3801.aspx">convincing rhetoric 
</A>:).</P>
<P>I know there's a better way to do what I'm doing, but I've almost got 
it...that makes this one of those days that I kind of wish it wasn't Friday - 
this thing is biting me, even tho I got it working under most circumstances.</P>
<P>I want to blame it on the control, but I'm not 100% sure I can do that since 
it's obfuscated and I can't just look at its properties and see what I'm doing 
wrong. Stupid obfuscators. Oh well, I'll get it done to how I like it later.</P>
<P>The control is great, don't get me wrong - it just doesn't work exactly as I 
would expect a robust control to work. Not that it's built incorrectly, I'm just 
expecting different behavior than it's giving me.</P>
<P>Enough whining. I'm going home. :P</P>
