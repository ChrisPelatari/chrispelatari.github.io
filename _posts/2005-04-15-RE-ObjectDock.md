<blockquote>
  <p>Who else out there likes a dock better than the standard windows taskbar? I 
  have been using <a href="http://www.stardock.com/">StarDock</a>'s <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/">ObjectDock</a> for a 
  few weeks now and I think I'm sold. I have hidden my taskbar and I only run a 
  single visible dock at the bottom center of my screen. </p>

<p>Big smile on my face from this one - I recognize the plainer looking icon in 
the picture above. I knew that Wes was running PostXING (heck, his <a href="http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/">CodeHTMLer </a>is a big part of it) but 
it's really cool to see it really there, as one of the few programs he 
needs "docked". </p>
