title: Intellisense problem solved.
---
<p>For anyone else who might have run into Intellisense weirdness, I found that just 'touching' the file that was generated by vs.net for the dataset and recompiling gave intellisense its needed kick in the rear. </p>

<p>All I did was go to the file, hit enter, hit backspace, shift+ctrl+b, and intellisense was ready again to do my bidding. Weird, but it worked for me :)</p>
