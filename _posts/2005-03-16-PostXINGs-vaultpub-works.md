<p>This shouldn't have gotten this out of whack, but it did, sorry. I've made 
sure that all of the folders are inherited now, and tested the get latest 
version on a different directory on my machine. </p>
<p><font color="red">WARNING</font>: The only thing to watch out for is that I 
like to copy my assemblies to my C:\bin folder so I can dogfood the output 
immediately. If you don't like that, go to the main PostXING project and clear 
out the build events. Also, the code that is now in the repository is more 
recent than the release on <a href="http://projectdistributor.net">Project 
Distributor</a>. It supports proxies for the web connection and has a couple of 
other bug fixes in it like handling FTP files with spaces. One more thing - not 
all of the projects in the trunk are either deployed to the world or active - 
the Client Template plugin project allows you to define a custom template on the 
client side (since dotText doesn't implement this particular metablog api 
feature) and the offline plugin was going to be the save/load posts feature but 
that got put into the main project instead. It's still there because someday I 
may decide to make it handle online/offline capabilities differently.</p>
