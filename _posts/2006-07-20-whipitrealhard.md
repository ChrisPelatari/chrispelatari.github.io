an impromtu text message saying that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostface_Killah">Ghostface
Killah</a> was playing at Warehouse live downtown. As a Wu-Tang fan, I
decided to go out and see what he was all about. Pretty good show, I really dug
the ODB medley they did in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol%27_Dirty_Bastard">Ol' Dirty</a>. <a href="http://chrispelatari.files.wordpress.com/2006/07/wudirty.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1145" alt="wudirty" src="http://chrispelatari.files.wordpress.com/2006/07/wudirty.gif" width="108" height="144" /></a>

As an extra added bonus, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_%28rapper%29">Rick Ross</a> opened
up for Ghostface. He only did like 5 tracks, but was spot on for Hustlin'. He's
obviously very comfortable with the song by now and it shows in his performance.
Looked like he was really having fun with it which always helps for a good
show.
