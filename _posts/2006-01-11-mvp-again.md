<p>So I got selected for the <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/">MVP 
</a>award again this year. Many thanks to BenMi, who has been an awesome lead 
this whole time. You rock, dude.</p>
<p>I was also awarded the (unofficial) <a href="http://angrypets.com/tools/rdos">ReverseDoS</a> MVP award for my 
unending quest to tell anyone who is fed up with comment spam about it. If 
you're running an asp.net blogging engine (really, anything that could generate 
spam from automated bots that runs asp.net) you owe it to yourself to check this 
component out.</p>
<p>Since installing and configuring it correctly, I have gotten exactly 1 (one) 
comment spam, and it was a manual entry. None that are automated, tho. Nice 
:)</p>
