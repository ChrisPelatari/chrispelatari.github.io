So I had the first weekend alone with my son, Ethan, this past weekend. It 
was awesome! What a perfect father's day gift - being able to actually spend (at 
least) some of it with my son. He even "got me a card". See, he's 2 1/2 so it 
was my mom that really got the card, but she helped him sign it and he drew some 
circles in it for me. :)

There were a couple of times that he cried for his mother, but we got thru 
those and it was only when he was expecting something out of his normal routine. 
All in all, I would say that he did an excellent job considering this was the 
first time that he ever spent the night with me, away from his mother.

I could sit here and go on and on about the details of our weekend, but let's 
just leave this at it was one of the greatest experiences I've had with him 
ever. I am so happy that it's finally happening!
