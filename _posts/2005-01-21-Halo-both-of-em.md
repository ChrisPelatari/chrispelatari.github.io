title: Halo (both of 'em)
---
<p>I've been playing Halo 2 recently, and I got to a part that reminded me why I 
lost interest in the first one.</p>
<p>Once you get to a certain part of the game (either one), it gets so difficult 
to advance that it's not fun anymore. Now, granted, I've never been close to 
being <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0098663/">the Wizard</a>,Â but gimme 
a break already. I guess it's back to <a href="http://www.princeofpersiagame.com/us/home2.php">Prince of Persia 
</a>(again, either one) for me. <a href="http://www.ubi.com">UbiSoft</a> gets 
it. Make a game that I'll want to play over and over.</p>
<p>&lt;/rant type="As If You Cared"&gt;</p>
