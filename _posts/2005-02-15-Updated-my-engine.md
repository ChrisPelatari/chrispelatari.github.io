Well, thanks toÂ <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/">Steven's 
</a>post<!--StartFragment --> <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2005/01/10/167.aspx">.Text's 
MetaWeblog API - Edit Post Error...</a> I am now just a couple of revisions 
behind the latest incarnation of .Text <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog">over here</a>.

This has been a serious pain to get migrated from v0.94 (all because I need 
to edit my posts w/ the metablog api - go figure!) but a lot of it has been due 
to errors on my part. When you try to add content, you've gotta keep those 
Identity fields intact or you end up with "Server returned a fault exception" 
when adding a new post. Yuck.

<p><font color="red">Update2:</font> Continuing my battle with this engine: It 
looks like the entry.FeedBackCount doesn't like to be DBNull or whatever 
(Imagine that!). I think I just might be g2g w/ the v0.95 .Text installation.
