title: WORA...log4net
---
[Luke Blogs](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/06/25-102.html) of the dream of WORA.

Slightly more interesting to me at this point, tho, is his experiences with [log4net](http://log4net.sourceforge.net/), the popular .NET alternative to log4j...This is the kind of stuff I've been looking for, and would have if I had more than 2.5 readers. (That third one is on and off ;)

See, I have a current incarnation of an application that uses the [Exception Management Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/emab-rm.asp) from M$, plus some custom schtuff I put in so I could have notification via email. I got very little feedback on which was the best to use, and the general concensus was that log4net has a broader range of purpose.

That's cool, but added to this, I doubt I would run into Luke's problem simply because I've yet to write a downloadable windows forms application, so my apps sit on a server which I have a lot of control over.

Eh.
