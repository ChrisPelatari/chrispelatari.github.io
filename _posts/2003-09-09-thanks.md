<p>I want to say thanks to those who have given me feedback on a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cfrazier/posts/26789.aspx#FeedBack">previous post</a>. It's given me a little bit more insight into this beast called SqlServer. Anyways, I think perhaps I should ask this particular question on a listeserv of some sort, or maybe stick with just dynamically creating the sql text - given the fact that this particular endeavor is a windows forms project that shouldn't go outside of my company...</p>
