title: "RE: This is gonna piss some people off..."
---

So earlier I said "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cfrazier/archive/2005/01/28/362869.aspx">This is 
gonna piss some people off...</a>" about the EntLib, right? Well, straight from 
the developer's mouth:


<blockquote>
  <div class="comment_author"><a id="Comments.ascx_CommentList__ctl1_NameLink" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdensmore" target="_blank">Scott 
  Densmore</a></div>
  <div class="comment_content">The registration process is to help us better 
  connect with you. I hope it doesn't detract you from downloading. I think you 
  will love it.</div></blockquote>
  
<div class="comment_content" dir="ltr">Well, I hope I didn't come across as "I'm not 
going to download it", cuz I most definitely am. Matter of fact, I'm downloading 
now. I just thought it would be interesting to see who would say such classics 
as "The mothership is tracking you!" or some other garbage like that. Why would 
I not want to register with Microsoft? They're already tracking my behaviors on 
Windows XP (HAHA! just kidding (or am I?)) :)</div>
