<p>I'd like to apologize if any users of <a href="http://postxing.net">PostXING</a> have to go thru proxies...I've been 
bugchasing this evening and it occurred to me that specifying a proxy for a new 
blog is kind of...well, weird.</p>
<p>First, it's a wizard-style dialog, so you expect the next/back buttons to 
work like it would in say an installer (well, I would anyways). Instead, you've 
got to specify at least a host, "page", and port, click on a special linkbutton 
(not next), click back to specify now the rest of the properties (including 
re-typing what you've already typed) and <em>then</em> you can go to select 
which blog you want to use.</p>
<p>I don't have an answer for this yet, but I'm working on it.
