I <em>really</em> dig the 
"type inside the preview" Web Layout. That's just sweet. The plugin support 
looks promising...I've already started coding up a CodeHTMLer plugin for syntax 
highlighting ala PostXING, now if I can get one going that will allow me to post 
the same content to more than one blog I'll be in business. I've been on a 
little hacking-hiatus on PostXING for the past few months to spend the 
summertime with my son Ethan, so what a great way to stretch my geek muscle all 
over again at the end of summer! </p>
