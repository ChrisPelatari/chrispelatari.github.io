title: Does this mean I've made it?
---
<p>It took nearly two years, but it looks like I've posted something interesting 
enough to show up on the <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind512.html">Daily Grind</a>. </p>
<p>It's linked over <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cfrazier">there</a>Â as 
opposed to <a href="http://www.chrisfrazier.net/blog">here</a>, tho, which makes 
me that much happier that I can syndicate identical content to more than one 
place, one of said places getting a tremendously larger amount of traffic than 
the others.</p>
