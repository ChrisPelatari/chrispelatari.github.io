<p>I just can't pimp <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke/">Darren's</a> new 
<a href="http://markitup.aspxconnection.com">ProjectDistributor</a>Â enough. 
Look at <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dneimke/archive/2004/11/04/251886.aspx">the ideas 
</a>this guy comes up with. Every time I chat with him, something new is coming 
down the pike. Let me say, not just new, but innovative, fresh...sometimes so 
beautifully simple that I have to think "why didn't I think of that?". You know 
you're onto something when you make others say that.</p>
<p>Anyways, Thanks Darren for giving me a little space to place my snippets and 
for coming up with a great idea that keeps getting better.</p>
