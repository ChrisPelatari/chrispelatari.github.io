I'm Chris Pelatari, a seasoned software developer with over 22 years of experience in delivering full-stack web applications using .NET technologies, including C# and VB.NET. During my career, I've been recognized for my expertise in the field and awarded [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com) status for three consecutive years for my contributions to the [ASP.NET](https://asp.net) community.

As a proud member of the [AspInsiders](https://aspinsiders.com), I've had the opportunity to work closely with Microsoft, including being flown out to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA to help shape the direction of ASP.NET MVC before it was open-sourced. I had the honor of meeting [Scott Guthrie](http://scottgu.com/), too many brilliant colleagues to name (you can see most of them [here](https://aspinsiders.com/insiders/)) and [Anders Hejlsberg](https://github.com/ahejlsberg), the original designer of C#.

My focus has always been on delivering properly tested and scalable applications that are backed by SQL Server. I have a strong understanding of software development best practices, including object-oriented programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration and deployment.
