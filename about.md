I'm Chris Pelatari, a seasoned software developer with over 22 years of experience in delivering full-stack web applications using .NET technologies, including C# and VB.NET. During my career, I've been recognized for my expertise in the field and awarded [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com) status for three consecutive years for my contributions to the [ASP.NET](https://asp.net) community.

As a proud member of the [AspInsider](https://aspinsiders.com) community, I've had the opportunity to work closely with Microsoft, including being flown out to their headquarters in Bellevue, WA to help shape the direction of ASP.NET MVC before it was open-sourced. During this time, I had the honor of meeting Scott Guthrie, too many brilliant colleagues to name (you can see most of them at the link above) and Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#.

My focus has always been on delivering properly tested and scalable applications that are backed by SQL Server and deployed using CI/CD. I have a strong understanding of software development best practices, including object-oriented programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration and deployment.
